        Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is the inflammation or infection of the
        conjunctiva, the membrane covering the white part of the eye and the
        inner eyelid. This article will explore the symptoms, causes and
        treatment of pink eye, or conjunctivitis.
      </p>
      <p class="para-content">
        Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is caused by a range of factors including
        bacterial infections, viral infections, allergies and irritants. The
        most common pink eye symptoms, or symptoms of conjunctivitis, are a
        reddening of the conjunctiva, itchy eyes, sore eyes and discharge from
        the eye. Treatment for pink eye or conjunctivitis is dependent upon what
        type of pink eye a person has. Treatment for allergic conjunctivitis may
        include antihistamines, whilst viral and bacterial conjunctivitis
        treatment may include eye drops to alleviate symptoms.

          <p class="para-content">
            Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is
            <b>the inflammation, irritation or infection of the conjunctiva</b>.
            The conjunctiva refers to the clear membrane that sits over the
            white parts of the eyes and the inner eyelids. Conjunctivitis is
            referred to as pink eye due the reddening of the conjunctiva that
            occurs when infected or inflamed. Pink eye or conjunctivitis is a
            common eye problem. According to The Royal Children’s Hospital
            Melbourne, conjunctivitis is an especially common eye infection in
            children under five.
          </p>
          <p class="para-content">
            There are several types of conjunctivitis including bacterial, viral
            and allergic conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis, or pink eye, that is
            caused by viral or bacterial infections are contagious, whilst
            allergic conjunctivitis, which occurs due to irritants such as
            pollen or dust, are not contagious. According to The Royal
            Children’s Hospital of Melbourne, conjunctivitis can last from two
            days to three weeks. If pink eye occurs as a result of infection,
            symptoms usually begin to develop after two days. Conjunctivitis
            will be infectious until the eye discharge that accompanies the
            condition is gone.

              Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, can be caught by anyone. According to

              Bacterial or viral conjunctivitis is generally caught through

              airborne particles generated by coughing and sneezing.

                  Having a red inner eyelid or white of the eye, is a common

                  vessels. Having a red inner eyelid or white of the eye, is a

                  Eye discharge in one or both eyes, that forms a crust during

                  a possible symptom of pink eye, or conjunctivitis. According

                  <b>describes a secretion of fluids from the eye.</b> If a
                  person has pink eye or conjunctivitis, eye discharge can be
                  present during the day, but also at night.

                  There are several types of eye discharge including watery
                  discharge and white discharge. The type of eye discharge and
                  the exact cause can be dependent on the type of conjunctivitis

                <p class="para-content">
                  Eye discharge during a case of pink eye occurs due to the
                  irritation or infection of the conjunctiva, with the overnight
                  crusting due to a lack of blinking or clearing of the
                  discharge. Unlike during the day, when we blink and the tear
                  film of the eye keeps the eye moist, at night, the lack of
                  blinking causes a build up of discharge, which leads to
                  crusting. According to the Centre for Disease Control and
                  Prevention (CDC), eye discharge that causes crusting overnight
                  is usually caused by bacterial conjunctivitis, or pink eye.

                  Light sensitivity during conjunctivitis may be caused by the

                Pink eye symptoms will feel different depending on what type of
                pink eye you have and the symptoms associated with that type of
                conjunctivitis. Those who have allergic, bacterial or viral
                conjunctivitis may have symptoms that make the eyes feel itchy,
                cause a burning sensation or feel watery. Those with bacterial
                pink eye, may have yellow, white or green discharge that makes
                the eye feel sticky.

                What causes pink eye in adults is dependent on what type of pink
                eye (conjunctivitis) that they have. Bacterial conjunctivitis is
                caused by bacteria that can be spread through direct hand to eye
                contact or indirectly through droplets from the respiratory
                tract. Viral conjunctivitis is caused by a virus, often the same
                virus found in the common cold, and also spread through direct
                contact with someone or something with the virus, or indirectly
                through respiratory droplets. Pink eye can also be caused by an
                allergic reaction to irritants or allergens such as pollen,
                chemicals or animal dander. Pink eye is a common eye condition
                for adults, but viral and bacterial pink eye are also highly
                prevalent in children as, according to The American Academy of

                people at school, and their hygiene practices are not as good as
                adults, facilitating the spread more easily.

              Antihistamines may be recommended by a healthcare professional to

              Histamine attempts to fight inflammation. In the case of
              inflammation caused by allergies, this histamine response can
              manifest in sensations such as sneezing, itchy and watery eyes. A
              health care professional may recommend antihistamines in cases of
              allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is caused by
              exposure to irritants such as dust, animal dander, chemicals and
              pollen. Antihistamines may help to bring eye inflammation down and
              reduce conjunctivitis symptoms such as itchy eyes. Antihistamines
              can include oral tablets or eye drops.

              It is important to avoid touching or rubbing the eye that has

              discharge from the eyes may help reduce irritation, and help the

              pads or washcloths every time a person wipes the eye so that the

              The answer to the question, how do you get pink eye, also depends
              on what type of conjunctivitis a person has. Viral conjunctivitis
              and bacterial conjunctivitis are both contagious, meaning they
              will spread through direct or indirect contact. Allergic
              conjunctivitis or pink eye is a reaction to an irritant such as
              pollen, animal fur or chemicals and is not contagious.

                Can Eyeglasses be Used to Prevent Pink Eye from Spreading?

                Eyeglasses may be used to prevent pink eye from spreading as

                  eyes, stopping a person from touching the eyes and potentially
                  spreading the infection</b
                >. Eyeglasses, more generally referred to as glasses, are a type
                of eyewear that serve several purposes depending on the type.
                Optical glasses provide vision correction, whilst
                non-prescription glasses such as sunglasses provide protection
                from the sun and its UV rays. Though the primary use of
                eyeglasses is vision assistance and protection, they may act as
                a tool to prevent pink eye by making someone more conscious of
                touching the eyes, providing a physical barrier between the
                hands and the eyes. The less a person touches the eyes, the less
                likely they are to spread pink eye. If you have pink eye, it is
                also important to wash your glasses to help limit the spread.
