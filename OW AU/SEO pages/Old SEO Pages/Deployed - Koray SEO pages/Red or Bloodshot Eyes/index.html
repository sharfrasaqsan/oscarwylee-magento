        Red or bloodshot eyes are a common symptom of many different eye
        conditions and this article will discuss the causes, treatment and
        prevention of this eye affliction. Red eyes, or red eye, is a condition
        that affects the conjunctiva which is a thin membrane that covers the
        white part of the eye (sclera) turning it red due to the dilation of
        tiny blood vessels. It may happen in one or both eyes making the eyes
        look more red than usual and is often painless.
        <br /><br />
        The main symptom of bloodshot eyes is red appearing in the whites of the
        eyes. This may be caused by certain eye conditions such as
        conjunctivitis which can be treated with antibiotics.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Why are My Eyes Red?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Red eyes are caused by many different things, therefore, the question,
        why are my eyes red, is difficult to determine although there are common
        reasons it is caused. Eyes become bloodshot when tiny blood vessels in
        the eye dilate which may be caused by specific eye problems, or
        environmental reasons. The common causes of red eyes include allergies
        and dry eyes, which are usually not serious conditions and may be
        treated with eye drops.

          What Does Having Red or Bloodshot Eyes Mean?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Having red or bloodshot eyes means many different things, ranging from
          harmless causes to serious eye conditions. The actual reason the eyes
          are bloodshot is
          <b
            >due to the dilation of small blood vessels that are in the white of
            the eye which causes the red appearance of the eyes.</b
          >
          Another reason eyes become red is due to an eye injury. According to
          the Mayo Clinic, when the eye is injured, blood vessels in the eye
          become dilated, bringing the blood and cells to repair and heal the
          injury.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Allergies</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          A prominent cause of red or bloodshot eyes is an allergic reaction to
          pollens, moulds, animal dander and dust mites, which are all
          environmental allergens. According to the NHS, the symptoms of an
          allergic reaction include red eyes, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and
          swollen eyes, throat and mouth.
          <br /><br />
          The treatment for allergies is allergy medication, allergy avoidance
          and immunotherapy. Allergies are not usually painful but a constant
          irritation. Allergies are not typically something to worry about
          unless they are causing significant disruptions to day-to-day
          activities.

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">2. Pink Eye</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Pink eye (conjunctivitis) is an inflammation of the conjunctiva which
          is a lining covering the white part of the eye. It is caused by the
          dilation of small blood vessels in the conjunctiva, making the eye
          appear a pinkish-red colour. The symptoms of pink eye are watery eyes,
          itchy, irritated and sore eyes, crusting in the eye’s corners and
          white strings or yellow discharge from the eye.
          <br /><br />
          Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is treated with antibiotic drops or
          cream. Pink eye may be painful due to the sore and gritty feeling in
          the eyes. According to the NHS Inform, this eye condition, while
          irritating, in most cases does not pose a serious threat to the eye or
          your health.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">3. Dry Eyes</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Symptoms of dry eyes occur because either the tears in a person’s eyes
          evaporate too quickly or the eyes are not producing enough tears. The
          symptoms of dry eyes include sore, burning, red or gritty eyes, watery
          eyes, blurry vision, eyelids sticking together and glare sensitivity.
          Dry eyes are treated with tear supplement eye drops, warm compresses
          and certain supplements such as vitamin A and omega 3.
          <br /><br />
          Dry eyes are sometimes painful due to the symptom of irritated eyes
          but is managed with eye drops. This eye condition is not usually
          something to be worried about as it can be treated but if the
          condition persists, causes serious pain or interferes with daily life,
          it is advised to see an eye health professional.

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">4. Broken Blood Vessels</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Broken blood vessels, also known as a subconjunctival haemorrhage, is
          caused by bleeding from a broken or burst blood vessel. These broken
          blood vessels often heal on their own after 1-2 weeks and can be
          caused by sneezing, eye rubbing and coughing.
          <br /><br />
          The main symptom of broken blood vessels is the white part of the eye
          turning red in certain patches. Subconjunctival haemorrhages do not
          usually require treatment as they will improve on their own. If the
          person feels some discomfort, they may use eye drops to freshen the
          eyes. Broken blood vessels are painless and not something to worry
          about as they are almost always harmless according to NSW Health.

          vision, loss of vision, or cloudy vision. Vision changes occur either
          in one eye or both and are most often caused by refractive errors.
          However some changes in vision can be an indication of a serious eye
          condition. Changes in vision that are accompanied by red or bloodshot
          eyes, are indications that the person should see a doctor or eye care
          professional as they could have a serious eye condition. Changes in
          vision may be connected to red eyes as combined they could be an
          indication of an autoimmune disorder or severe infections.

            If a person has a bloodshot eye only on one side, it means the red
            eye is most likely caused by an infection rather than an allergy. If

            allergic reaction would come into contact with a large area of the
            body, therefore, it would be unlikely that it was concentrated in
            one eye only.

          To prevent red or bloodshot eyes, avoid having fans or other sources

          air hitting your eyes dries the moisture making them dry and

          According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to
          prevent bacteria from spreading you should wash your hands with warm
          water and soap for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching the eyes
          with unwashed, dirty hands. Hand washing is extremely important in
          preventing the spread of conjunctivitis of which symptoms include red

            At Oscar Wylee, we recommend that if you have red eyes, that you

            optometrist, with eye drops and cool compresses and by washing your
            hands and cleaning bedding regularly.

            Yes and no. Most of the time, red or bloodshot eyes are symptoms of

            which is why if it causes serious pain or does not go away, you
            should visit your doctor or eye care professional to get your eyes
