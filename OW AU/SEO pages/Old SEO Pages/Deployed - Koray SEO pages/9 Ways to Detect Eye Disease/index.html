    <h1 class="title">10 Ways to Detect Eye Disease</h1>
    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content mobile-para-margin">
        The 10 ways to detect an eye disease generally involve a comprehensive
        eye exam, an optical coherence tomography (OCT), a visual field test, a
        retinal exam and a self-examination. Other ways may include genetic
        testing, fluorescein angiography, electroretinogram (ERG), tonometry and
        an Amsler grid. Having your eyes tested once every two years can help
        maintain the health of your eyes and can help optometrists detect signs
        of eye disease early. Some of the symptoms an eye disease can present
        may include swelling around the eye, sudden blurry vision, red eyes,
        headaches, and light sensitivity, according to the Optometrists Network.
        Other symptoms can include clouded vision, dry eyes, inability to focus
        eyes, and crossed eyes according to Harvard Health Publishing. The
        causes of eye disease may include diabetes, increased age, high blood
        pressure, obesity and a poor diet. It is important to note that these
        causes are common across certain eye diseases only and can depend on
        factors according to the patient. To diagnose eye diseases, optometrists
        will perform standard eye examinations as well as ask patients about
        their medical history and current medications.<br /><br />
        The 10 ways to detect eye diseases and their definitions are listed
        below.

      <h2 class="subtitle">1. Comprehensive Eye Exam</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        A comprehensive eye exam is a series of tests that can assist with the
        detection of common eye diseases. Comprehensive eye exams can help with
        detecting eye diseases such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, corneal
        ulcers and macular degeneration. According to the American Optometric
        Association, the optometrist may conduct preliminary tests of your eye
        health and visual function, depth perception, colour vision, peripheral
        vision and response to light. Other important tests include looking at
        your refractive status, the ability to move your eyes and checking your
        overall eye health according to the American Optometric Association.
        Checking your medical history will help the optometrist to gain a better
        understanding of your condition. Visual acuity is intended to examine
        the clarity of your vision by reading out the letters on a chart from a
        certain distance. Your refractive status will be based on whether you
        are nearsighted, farsighted or have astigmatism. For the evaluation of
        your eye health, your optometrist may need to use a lens, digital
        technology and microscopes to evaluate the structures of the eye and the
        tissues surrounding the eye.

      <h2 class="subtitle">2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging test that allows the
        examination of the retina. Optical coherence tomography can help with
        diagnosing eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration,
        glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy among many other conditions. This
        test works by using light waves to take images of your retina and
        enables an ophthalmologist to examine each layer of the retina, helping
        them to identify and measure the thickness of those layers. Looking at
        these measurements assists with diagnosing eye diseases and guidance for
        the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic
        eye disease, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. During
        an OCT, you will be positioned in front of a machine where your eyes
        will be scanned.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">3. Visual Field Test</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        A visual field test helps the optometrist assess how much you can see up
        and down in your eyes without moving your head and eyes. It can also
        identify whether you have blindspots in your peripheral vision. A visual
        field test can be performed by an optometrist and can assist in
        identifying indications of diseases such as glaucoma. As glaucoma may
        not show symptoms, a visual field test can detect peripheral vision
        loss. At Oscar Wylee, this test can be done if the optometrist deems it
        necessary for your condition.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">4. Retinal Exam</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        A retinal exam, also referred to as a fundoscopy, is a test that
        assesses the retina and optic nerve. A retinal exam is conducted by
        placing eye drops that widen the pupil to allow the optometrist to look
        at the retina more closely. A retinal exam can also enable the
        optometrist to assess the back region of the eye which includes the
        blood vessel layer, known as the choroid according to the Associated
        Retina Consultants. A retinal exam can detect eye diseases such as
        glaucoma, macular degeneration and eye cancer according to the National
        Institute of Cancer. Other tools such as an ophthalmoscope or a
        slit-lamp biomicroscope can also be used to conduct this diagnostic
        test.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">5. Self-Examination</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Self-examination can be done by using an Amsler grid, which you can do
        by yourself at home. Monitoring any visual changes can help with the
        early detection of potential eye diseases. According to the Vision Eye
        Institution, using an Amsler grid which can be downloaded online, can
        help you monitor any changes to your vision. However, it is strongly
        advised to seek an examination from an eye care professional before
        resorting to self-examination.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">6. Genetic Testing</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Genetic testing may be helpful for eye diseases that are suspected to be
        inherited. Genetic testing can aid in diagnosing diseases such as
        macular degeneration. However, genetic testing may not be advised as the
        complex nature of multiple gene variations and environmental risk
        factors accompanied by disease progression can make it difficult to
        understand the results according to the Macular Degeneration Foundation.
        It is currently advised that you should get your eyes tested regularly
        if there is age-related macular degeneration in your family history.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">7. Fluorescein Angiography</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Fluorescein angiography is a test that takes photos of the retina which
        enables an examination of the blood vessels in the back of the eye. A
        fluorescein angiography test works by injecting the fluorescein dye
        through your arm. The dye will pass through your body and highlight the
        blood vessels. As the dye flows through the retina, a camera is then
        used to capture images, which will enable the ophthalmologist to
        identify problems and where they can target treatment. Fluorescein
        angiography is normally used for detecting eye diseases such as macular
        edema, diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration according to the
        American Academy of Ophthalmology. The retina is located towards the
        back of the eye and functions to convert the light that comes through
        your eyes into signals. These signals go through the optic nerve and are
        then sent to the brain. At Oscar Wylee, we do not perform this imaging
        test as we do not have an ophthalmologist on site. Our optometrist will
        refer you to an ophthalmologist if your condition requires this test.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">8. Electroretinogram (ERG)</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        An electroretinogram measures the retina’s electrical activity in
        response to light stimulus according to the American Optometric
        Association. An electroretinogram works by dilating your pupils first
        and may use anesthetic drops to numb the eye. A contact lens-sized
        electrode is then placed in both eyes. An electrode is also placed on
        your skin to serve as a ground for the slight electrical signals from
        the retina. A flashing light will be shown while in regular light and in
        a dark room allowing the electrodes to measure the retina’s response to
        light. The results are demonstrated on a monitor in the form of waves.
        This test can help with identifying eye diseases such as macular
        degeneration as well as other diseases according to Healthline. This
        test is not conducted at Oscar Wylee.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">9. Tonometry</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Tonometry is a test that is conducted as part of the pre-testing process
        to evaluate the pressure of the eye. A tonometry can be carried out by
        applying force to your cornea and will indicate how much force was
        needed to flatten the cornea. If more force was needed, that can
        indicate high intraocular pressure, which is a factor in developing
        glaucoma. A tonometry test can help determine your treatment plan. The
        type of tonometry test can be decided based on your visual needs.

    <section class="section-border-bottom">
      <h2 class="subtitle">10. Amsler Grid</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        An Amsler grid is a square grid with a dot in the centre that can be
        used to detect problems with your vision. If you have been diagnosed
        with age-related macular degeneration, the lines on the grid will appear
        to have wavy lines or spots with no lines. If you experience these
        changes, it is important to contact your ophthalmologist right away
        according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What Are Eye Diseases?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Eye diseases are problems in the eye that require more advanced care and
        treatment from an ophthalmologist. Common eye diseases such as glaucoma,
        macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and age-related
        macular degeneration are diseases that can lead to vision loss and other
        complications in the eye. However, there are also eye conditions that
        may also fall under the broad term of eye disease, such as refractive
        errors, amblyopia and strabismus.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What to Know More About Detecting Eye Diseases</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        It is important to know that there are no safety risks involved when
        detecting eye diseases. For certain eye exams that require eye drops for
        pupil dilation, you may experience blurred vision temporarily. Other
        types of eye exams that use special machinery such as retinal imaging or
        optical coherence tomography also pose no risks to patients’ safety.
        According to the Cleveland Clinic, fluorescein angiography may include
        side effects such as discolouration in the skin, dark or tinted vision
        and a burning sensation in the skin if the fluorescein dye leaks during
        the injection. These side effects may last for a few minutes. Depending
        on your eye condition and the type of eye exam performed, your
        optometrist or ophthalmologist will likely advise you not to drive for
        up to 24 hours.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">What Are the Common Eye Diseases?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          The common eye diseases are glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic
          retinopathy, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Other eye
          conditions that are common are refractive errors, strabismus
          (misaligned eyes) and amblyopia (lazy eye). These conditions are eye
          problems that will require a professional diagnosis by an optometrist.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">What Causes Eye Diseases?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          The causes of eye disease are diabetes, increased age, high blood
          pressure, obesity and a poor diet. These causes are common across many
          eye diseases, however, it is important to acknowledge that there are
          other factors and circumstances that could also contribute to
          developing eye diseases.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">Can Eye Diseases Be Hereditary?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Yes, eye diseases can be hereditary. Eye diseases that have links to
          genetic factors are retinal degeneration, congenital glaucoma,
          congenital cataracts, optic atrophy and eye malformations. According
          to the Cleveland Clinic, most of these eye diseases are the leading
          causes of blindness among infants. Other conditions that can be linked
          to genetics are refractive errors, strabismus and glaucoma. According
          to the Centre for Eye Research Australia, inherited retinal eye
          diseases can occur due to flaws or changes in the genes. These flaws
          can cause the retina’s cells to function abnormally.

            be administered by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Three common
            tests used to detect eye diseases include a comprehensive eye test,
            a visual field test and a tonometry test. The common tests performed
            to detect certain eye diseases and their definitions are listed
            below.

            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Comprehensive eye test:</span>
              A comprehensive eye test is performed by an optometrist and
              includes a series of tests that can detect common eye diseases. It
              is recommended that a person has an eye test at least once every
              two years to maintain eye health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Visual field test:</span>
              A visual field test will be performed on indication and is used to
              assess a person’s peripheral vision and visual scope. This test
              quantifies how well a patient can see through each eye,
              individually and binocularly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Tonometry:</span>
              Tonometry is a test typically performed during pre-testing to
              evaluate eye pressure. Tonometry is often used to assess for the
              eye disease glaucoma as it can be associated with high eye
              pressure.

            Can Self-examination Help Detect Eye Diseases?
          </h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            No, self-examination to detect eye diseases is not advised as
            certain eye diseases require special optometry equipment to
            diagnose. Self-examination may be used to assess visual acuity but,
            overall, it is recommended people book an appointment with an
            optometrist to receive a comprehensive eye test which will include
            an assessment of a patient’s vision, and a check of eye health.

            Can a Retinal Exam Help Detect Signs of Disease?
          </h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            Yes, a retinal exam can help to detect signs of eye diseases
            including glaucoma, macular degeneration and eye cancer. A retinal
            exam is a diagnostic test, also known as a fundoscopy, that
            evaluates the back of the eye including the retina and the optic
            nerve. This exam often requires the patient’s pupils to be dilated
            to provide the optometrist with better visualisation of the eye.
