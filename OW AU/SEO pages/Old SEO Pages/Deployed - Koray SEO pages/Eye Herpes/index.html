      The eye herpes definition is an infection of the eye, caused by HSV-1. This article will explore the causes,
      symptoms, risk factors and treatment available for eye herpes. Eye herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus,
      specifically type one, also known as HSV-1. Once someone has contracted HSV-1, the virus will remain in the body,
      dormant, or until reactivated. The eye herpes causes, including factors that trigger a reactivation of the virus
      in the body, leading to eye herpes include stress, illness and menstruation. The eye herpes symptoms include eye
      pain, swelling around the eye, sensitivity to bright light, red eye, blurred vision, discharge and tearing. Eye
      herpes treatments include surgery, artificial tears, antiviral medications, steroid eye drops, pain relievers and
      cold compresses. The eye herpes risk factors include age, genetics and a weakened immune system.

    <h2 class="subtitle">How Do Eye Herpes Develop?</h2>
    <p class="para-content">
      Eye herpes develop due to the <b>contraction or reactivation of HSV-1, or type one HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus),
        within
        the body</b>. According to the NHS, people are generally exposed to HSV-1, the virus that causes eye herpes,
      when they
      are young. HSV-1 can stay inactive and asymptomatic in the body after exposure, until it is triggered and
      reactivated, leading to infections such as cold sores, or in some cases eye herpes. A person will contract HSV
      type one via <b>physical contact with an infected personâ€™s skin or mucous membranes, through sharing personal
        objects
        with an infected individual, or through transmission of the virus at birth</b>. The ways that the virus that
      causes
      eye herpes is transmitted and the reasons it develops are listed below.
    </p>

    <ul class="ordered-list">
      <li>
        <span class="list-title">Physical contact with an infected individual's skin or mucous membranes:</span>
        HSV-1, the virus that causes eye herpes, can be transmitted via physical contact with an infected person in
        which saliva or other bodily fluids are exchanged.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-title">Sharing personal objects, such as towels or cutlery, with an infected
          individual:</span>
        Eye herpes may develop after a person has shared personal objects that carry the HSV-1 virus, such as towels,
        cutlery, makeup or contact lenses. Those who have an active infection such as an active cold sore or eye herpes,
        are at a higher risk of transmitting the virus, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-title">Transmission of the virus at birth (for infants born to mothers with genital
          herpes):</span>
        Though rare, a baby can contract HSV during pregnancy, during birth from the birth canal, or postnatally. People
        who have genital herpes at the time of birth may pass on the herpes to the child, <b>which is a serious
          condition
          and requires immediate medical attention</b>. The type of HSV contracted during birth is usually type 2 HSV,
        which
        is less likely to cause eye herpes than type one. HSV contracted during birth is rare, affecting approximately
        10 out of every 100 000 births, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

      (Herpes
      Simplex Virus), specifically type 1 HSV which also causes other infections or sores such as cold sores. Eye herpes
      may be caused by type 2 herpes of HSV-2, but this is not as prevalent as HSV-1 causing eye herpes. Eye herpes can
      be classified into three general categories by healthcare experts, depending on what area of the cornea has been
      affected. The types of eye herpes can include <b>HSV stromal keratitis, HSV epithelial keratitis and HSV
        endothelial
        keratitis</b>. The types of eye herpes are listed below.

    <h2 class="subtitle">What are the Causes of Eye Herpes?</h2>
    <p class="para-content">
      The cause of eye herpes is usually <b>HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) type 1</b>. People with HSV most often contract
      it as
      children, with or without symptoms. For some people, HSV-1 can remain inactive in the system without symptoms, or
      it will be triggered into activating in the body, leading to infections such as cold sores or eye herpes. HSV can
      be activated randomly, or triggered by changes in the body such as <b>illness, periods and stress</b>. The causes
      or
      triggers that can potentially lead to HSV activating in the body and causing eye herpes are listed below.
    </p>

    <ul class="ordered-list">
      <li>
        <span class="list-title">Illness:</span>
        Being ill can cause eye herpes as illness leads to a low immune system, which may allow the virus to reactivate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-title">Periods:</span>
        Hormonal changes that are experienced during the menstrual cycle, can trigger an eye herpes infection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-title">Stress:</span>
        Stress may trigger eye herpes as stress can weaken the immune system, allowing HSV-1 to reactivate in the body.

    <div class="sub-div">
      <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Illness</h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        Illness can cause eye herpes as <b>being ill affects the immune system and general health of the body</b>,
        allowing
        HSV-1, the virus that causes eye herpes, to reactivate in the body. Illness is defined as a disease or condition
        that affects the health of the body or the mind. Illnesses that affect the body often involve the immune system.
        The immune system helps the body combat illness and is a combination of cells, organs and tissues, according to
        the US National Cancer Institute. When someone becomes sick, the immune system actively tries to fight the
        pathogens that are causing the illness. Changes to the immune system and the bodyâ€™s weaker overall state when
        ill, may trigger a reaction of HSV-1 in the body, which may lead to eye herpes. Illnesses that tend to
        reactivate HSV-1 include chest infections and the flu, according to the Victorian Governmentâ€™s Better Health
        Channel.

      <p class="para-content">
        Periods and the hormonal changes that occur during <b>the menstrual cycle may trigger the HSV-1 virus, in turn
          causing eye herpes</b>. The term period refers to the stage of the menstrual cycle in which the uterus sheds
        its
        lining leading to a period of bleeding. During the menstrual cycle, the hormones in the body fluctuate from
        stage to stage, which can potentially activate the HSV-1 in the body, causing infections such as cold sores or
        eye herpes. If <b>the body becomes run down or is put under strain due to menstruation</b>, this may also
        trigger a
        reactivation of HSV-1.

          <p class="para-content">
            Stress and the strain it causes the body can trigger the HSV-1 virus, in turn causing eye herpes. Stress
            refers to a feeling or reaction triggered by tension or pressure. Stress is a big concern in modern society,
            with stress triggers across daily life including work, finances, family and relationships. High levels of
            stress have been proven to have a negative effect on both mental and physical health, greatly straining the
            body. According to David A. Padgett et. al, in their paper <i>Social stress and the reactivation of latent
              herpes simplex virus type 1</i>, <b>stress is thought to weaken functions of the immune system, which can
              lead to

      <h3 class="sub-div-title">What are the Risk Factors of Eye Herpes?</h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        The risk factors for eye herpes revolve around what causes a HSV-1 infection to be contracted or to reactivate
        in the body. Eye herpes is most often caused by type one HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus), which infects the body and
        can lay dormant until reactivated by triggers such as illnesses, menstruation or stress. Risk factors for eye
        herpes include <b>factors that affect the immune system which may lead to a person contracting or triggering
          HSV-1
          in the body</b>. Risk factors for eye herpes include <b>age, genetics, a weakened immune system and prolonged
          sun
          exposure</b>. The risk factors for eye herpes are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Age:</span>
          Young children are more likely to contract HSV-1 for the first time, known as a primary HSV-1 infection, as
          they are frequently exposed to other children and their close contacts that possibly have the virus. Children
          are also not as hygienic as adults, which may lead to the spread of HSV-1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Genetics:</span>
          Eye herpes is not a hereditary condition, however, there are certain genetic factors that may heighten the
          risk of HSV-1 being reactivated in the body, leading to eye herpes. According to the Edinburgh Medical School,
          a mutation of the IL28b gene may prevent the immune system from responding to the HSV-1 virus, leading to
          reactivation of the virus and in turn such eye herpes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Weak immune system:</span>
          A weak immune system is a risk factor for eye herpes as it is more likely that the HSV-1 virus will reactivate
          whilst the immune system is weakened or compromised. The immune system may be weak due to a number of factors
          such as illness, stress, therapies such as radiation or chemotherapy, and sometimes even menstruation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Sun exposure:</span>
          Studies have suggested that exposure to the sun and the UV radiation it emits, potentially heightens the risk
          of eye herpes recurrent. According to Ludema C, Cole SR, Poole C, Smith JS, Schoenbach VJ, Wilhelmus KR in
          their study <i>Association Between Unprotected Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure and Recurrence of Ocular Herpes
            Simplex Virus</i>, people who spend 8 hours or more, outside in the sun when the UV index is high, are at a
          higher
          risk of eye herpes recurrence.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p class="para-content">
          Eye herpes <b>do not run in families</b>, however, some studies have suggested that <b>there are certain
            genetic factors
            that influence how a personâ€™s immune system will respond to HSV-1</b>, the virus that causes eye herpes and
          cold
          sores. According to Edinburgh Medical School, scientists have discovered that the mutation of the IL28b gene,
          may prevent the immune system from responding to the HSV-1 virus, leading to infections such as cold sores and
          eye herpes.

      <h3 class="sub-div-title">What is the Typical Age When Eye Herpes First Appears?</h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        There is <b>no typical age when eye herpes first appears as an active infection</b>, as the virus that causes
        eye
        herpes, HSV-1, can enter the system and lay dormant and asymptomatic until triggered. However, the first time a
        person comes into contact and is initially infected with HSV-1 is usually during childhood.

        <h4 class="sub-div-title">What are the Eye Herpes Complications?</h4>
        <p class="para-content">
          Eye herpes complications are usually minimal if the infection is treated in a timely manner. More serious
          cases of eye herpes that are left untreated may include <b>scarring of the cornea, further infection and
            blindness</b>. The possible eye herpes complications are listed below.

        <ul class="ordered-list">
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Scarring of the cornea:</span>
            Severe and untreated cases of eye herpes can potentially scar the cornea, the window at the front of the eye
            that lets light in. This may lead to long-term blurry vision, according to the NHS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Blindness:</span>
            Extreme and untreated cases of eye herpes may lead to blindness.

        Eye herpes is diagnosed through an eye test conducted by a healthcare professional, either <b>a doctor, an
          optometrist or an ophthalmologist</b>. A healthcare professional will likely use a <b>slit lamp microscope</b>
        to diagnose
        eye herpes, which is a microscope that allows for in depth examination of the eyeâ€™s structure. Dye in the form
        of eye drops applied to the surface of the eye, may also be used in the diagnosing of eye herpes, as this allows
        a greater examination of the structures of the eye. Other laboratory tests can be conducted if further
        information on the HSV-1 virus is needed.

      people can practise good hygiene such as limiting the sharing of personal items with people that have an active
      HSV-1 infection, such as eye herpes or cold sores. Personal items that may carry the eye herpes virus include
      contact lenses, makeup and towels. If a person already has the HSV-1 virus, which is a lifelong virus that stays
      within the body once contracted, prevention focuses on limiting outbreaks or reactivation of the virus. A person
      may help to prevent a reactivation of HSV-1 and in turn eye herpes, by undertaking lifestyle changes that promote
