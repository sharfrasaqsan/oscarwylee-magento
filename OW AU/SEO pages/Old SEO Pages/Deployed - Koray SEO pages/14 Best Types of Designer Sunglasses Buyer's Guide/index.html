              Polarised aviator sunglasses are best for usage in outdoor sports
              like fishing or hiking as the polarising effect helps reduce the
              discomfort of extreme brightness, glares and even enables a
              fisherman to see through the water's surface. Polarised aviator
              sunglasses share all the benefits and popularity of a standard
              pair of aviator glasses, including the glasses association with
              popular culture and its usage by high profile careers and persons.
              Polarising a pair of aviator sunglasses at Oscar Wylee adds a cost
              of $100 to the already existing cost of the aviator sunglasses.

              Oversized cat-eye sunglasses are best for any occasion, but are
              especially good for bright days and long exposure to sunlight, as
              the added volume of the glasses shields more of the face from UV
              rays. Oversized cat-eye sunglasses are a good choice of designer
              glasses because they combine the stunning design of cat-eye
              sunglasses with the added protection and striking individuality of
              oversized designs. Oversized cat-eye sunglasses are one of the
              best types of designer sunglasses because they are not only
              incredibly fashionable, but they are also safe and fully
              functional in a way other designer sunglasses may not be.
              <br /><br />
              Oversized cat-eye sunglasses are based on cat-eye frames, which
              are always in demand. Oversize cat-eye sunglasses have been worn
              by celebrities such as Beyonce and Hailey Bieber. A standard pair
              of oversized cat-eye sunglasses are available at Oscar Wylee
              starting from $169.

              Oval sunglasses are best for any occasion and are suitable for any

              sunglasses are suitable for any event, as the shape of the lens

              plastic, acetate or wider frames are good for casual usage. Oval
              sunglasses are one of the best types of designer glasses because
              many major designers and companies have their own version of the
              design, without losing the greater appeal of oval sunglasses.
              <br /><br />
              The demand for oval sunglasses changes depending on popular

              Designer glasses are glasses that are associated or specifically
              belong to a particular brand or company. Designer glasses are
              often made to be more personalised, well fitted or have been
              created with a higher level of materials than standard glasses.
              <br /><br />
              Designer glasses' purpose is to provide high quality eye
              protection in a way that is as aesthetically pleasing, trendy and
              fashionable as it is functional. Designer glasses must shield the
              wearer's eyes from UV rays and sun damage as well as match the
              wearer’s personal style, face and aesthetic.

                    the cheekbones. Oversized cat-eye glasses also extend over
                    the edges of a flat face, exaggerating the face's size and
                    contrasting the smaller features of the flat face to create
                    a more attractive profile.

            <h2 class="subtitle">How to Choose the Best Designer Glasses?</h2>
            <p class="para-content">
              The best designer glasses can be chosen by using the following
              methods: finding the right glasses style for the wearer’s face
              shape, carefully selecting the frames size to fit the wearer’s
              face, choosing pair of glasses that best match the wearers purpose
              and choosing the material that will suit the purpose the wearer
              wants. The following steps should be followed when choosing the
              best designer glasses.
            </p>

            <ol class="ordered-list">
              <li>
                <span class="list-title"
                  >Find the right glasses style for the face shape:</span
                >
                A person's face shape must be clear and defined before a wearer
                decides on the right pair of glasses. An oval face shape, for
                instance, will look better in sharper and blockier types of
                glasses, such as square frames of rectangle frames. A square
                face wearing square or rectangle glasses on will have the
                sharper and more intimidating features of the face too
                exaggerated, creating a less appealing profile.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="list-title"
                  >Select the frame size to fit the face:</span
                >
                Face shapes vary greatly from person to person, as can face
                size. On an oval face, large and oversized glasses flatter the
                profile's features and draw attention to the perfect symmetry an
                oval face has. On a square face, that same size of frames may
                draw attention to a jawline that is too sharp, or make the face
                seem smaller than it actually is.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="list-title"
                  >Choose glasses that match a purpose:</span
                >
                Polarised sunglasses may be perfect for outdoor activities or
                reducing the glare from the sun and the sun's reflection on any
                surface, but that same pair of glasses may not be suitable for a
                night event or an occasion that calls for a more professional
                appearance. The function and purpose for the glasses the wearer
                has should be decided on before purchasing a pair of designer
                glasses.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="list-title"
                  >Choose the material to suit purpose:</span
                >
                Some materials used in the creation of designer glasses are much
                more delicate and easy to break than others. Acetate frame
                glasses are cost effective, able to fit polarised or anti glare
                coated lenses, and are durable and flexible in their design,
                making them perfect for fishing or other boat activities. A pair
                of rimless metal aviator sunglasses may be made of material that
                is easy to bend and break, making them ill suited to outdoor
                activity.

                Why are Designer Glasses Usually Expensive?
              </h3>
              <p class="para-content">
                Designer glasses are usually expensive due to a combination of
                reasons, such as the cost of the materials used to create the
                glasses, the changes of colours and the demand for a specific
                set of glasses increasing the price, and added pricing for the
                brands recognition.

                  Is it Worthwhile to get Designer Glasses?
                </h4>
                <p class="para-content">
                  It is worthwhile to get designer glasses because the
                  reputation of the designer of the sunglasses, can be an
                  assurance that the product a consumer buys is of an acceptable
                  quality.
                  <br /><br />
                  Designer glasses are a worthwhile purchase because the brand
                  or company that made them add to the value of the product, but
                  also give the wearer more options for the glasses they have
                  purchased, such as more stores available to visit for
                  adjustments or repairs, more choices in add-ons or other
                  optical accessories and greater options for payment
