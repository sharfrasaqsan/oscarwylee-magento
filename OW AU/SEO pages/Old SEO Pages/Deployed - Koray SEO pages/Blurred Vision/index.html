      Blurred Vision: Definition, Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment
    </h1>
    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content mobile-para-margin">
        Blurred vision refers to multiple eye conditions and symptoms where the
        eyes are unable to focus properly, resulting in unclear and hazy vision.
        Blurred vision’s definition is an inability of the eyes to focus
        properly, resulting in blurry vision. Blurry vision causes include
        different eye conditions, such as refractive errors, myopia, glaucoma or
        macular degeneration. Blurred vision symptoms include eye floaters, hazy
        sight and photophobia. Blurred vision treatments include eye drops and
        laser surgery.
        <br /><br />
        Blurred vision is caused by common eye conditions, however, some
        symptoms of blurred vision, such as numb arms or painful migraines, may
        be shared with more severe and urgent conditions and should be checked
        as soon as possible to identify the cause of the eyes being blurry.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What is Blurred Vision?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Blurred vision is a term for a person's vision being hazy and unclear,
        due to certain eye conditions, such as <b>myopia or presbyopia</b>.
        Blurred vision refers to
        <b>the eyes being unable to see objects or people with full clarity</b>,
        as the world appears unclear.
      </p>

      <p class="para-content">
        <i>What does blurred vision look like?</i><br /><br />Blurred vision
        looks like the world is unfocused and hazy, as up-close or distant
        objects lose their precise and sharp details, depending on the distance
        to the object. Blurred vision may also affect a person's ability to see
        colour, making more vibrant shades appear grey and dull.

          <b>20,0000 to 30,0000 Australians</b> , according to the Centre for

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Nearsightedness or farsightedness:</span>
          Near or farsightedness causes blurred vision due to the eyes inability
          to focus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Cataracts:</span>
          Cataracts cause blurred vision because the gradual clouding of the
          lenses causes the eye to see less clearly and interrupts focus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Glaucoma:</span>
          Glaucoma causes blurred vision because damage to the optic nerve
          interferes with general vision abilities, including focusing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Dry eyes:</span>
          Dry eyes cause blurred vision because an issue with tears may be
          interfering with the cornea’s ability to receive light.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Astigmatism:</span>
          Astigmatism causes blurred vision because the unusually shaped cornea
          or lens causes the eye to be unable to focus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Presbyopia:</span>
          Presbyopia is what causes blurry vision as a person gets older.
          Presbyopia causes blurred vision because as the lens of the eye
          hardens and loses flexibility it causes the quality of general vision
          to decrease and makes the eye unable to focus as clearly.
        </li>

          <span class="list-title"
            >Age related macular degeneration (AMD):</span
          >
          Age related macular degeneration causes blurred vision by disrupting
          the macula’s ability to see straight ahead and interferes with
          straight and forward vision, causing blurriness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title"
            >Diabetic retinopathy or other retinal conditions:</span
          >
          Diabetic retinopathy or other retinal conditions causes blurred vision
          due to damaging the retina and blood vessels with high blood pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Eye injuries:</span>
          Eye injuries cause blurred vision by disrupting a function of part of
          the eye from working at full capacity, causing a general loss in
          vision skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Optic neuritis (rare):</span>
          Optic neuritis causes blurred vision by creating swelling on the optic
          nerve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Giant cell arteritis (rare):</span>
          Giant cell arteritis causes blurred vision by reducing the blood flow
          of the eyes, causing hazy vision and other eye problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">
            Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (rare):
          </span>
          Idiopathic intracranial hypertension causes blurred vision by placing
          pressure on the optic nerve, causing poorer vision and other eye
          issues.

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Neurofibromatosis type 2 (rare):</span>

        <p class="para-content">
          Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an eye condition where the
          eye struggles to focus on far distances. Farsightedness, also known as
          hyperopia, is an eye condition where the eyes struggle to focus on
          up-close objects or nearby distances. Nearsightedness or
          farsightedness are refractive errors caused by factors such as an
          unusually shaped lens or cornea. Near or farsightedness becomes a
          cause of blurred vision

        <p class="para-content">
          Cataracts are an eye condition where the crystalline lens of the eye
          begins to become clouded instead of clear. Cataracts are usually an
          age related eye condition. Cataracts cause blurred vision by
          <b>interfering with the lens’ ability to focus and receive light</b>
          . Blurred vision occurs with cataracts because the cloudy lens causes
          cloudy and blurry vision that may also reduce a person's ability to
          perceive colour.

          <b>damaging the eyes’ general ability to see</b> or deliver images to

              Conjunctivitis is a medical condition where the conjunctiva, or
              eyelid, becomes inflamed and causes the eye to turn bloodshot and
              red. Conjunctivitis can cause blurred vision because of the
              infection or inflammation interfering with general vision and
              parts of the eye’s ability to function properly, resulting in poor
              focus.

              Ocular migraine, also known as a migraine with aura depending on
              the migraine's symptoms, is a medical condition where a person may
              start seeing spots of colour and light across their vision, and
              feel a dull pain in their eyes and head. An ocular migraine causes
              blurred vision due to eyestrain and the colours in vision reducing
              focus.

              Keratitis is a medical condition where the cornea of the eye
              becomes inflamed due to infection. Keratitis causes blurred vision
              because it affects the cornea's general ability to focus the light
              that it receives, resulting in poorer vision skills, poor focus
              and hazy vision.
