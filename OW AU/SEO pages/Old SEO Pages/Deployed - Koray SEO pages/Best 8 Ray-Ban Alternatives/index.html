          Autoimmune diseases such as thyroid eye disease, rheumatoid arthritis
          and multiple sclerosis can lead to complications in the body including
          eye inflammation. Autoimmune diseases can trigger several symptoms in
          different parts of the body which often implicate the eyes. Being
          positive for the HLA-B27 protein on the white blood cells increases
          the risks of having autoimmune diseases and also increases likelihood
          of recurrent Uveitis.
