            Eye Exam for Children: Importance, Different Tests, Benefits, Signs,
            and Problems
          </h1>
          <p>
            Eye exams for children are a crucial aspect of taking care of their
            health and this article will discuss the importance, the different
            tests performed, the benefits of children’s eye exams and the signs
            of problems in children's vision.
            <br /><br />
            An eye exam for children is different from those for adults and can
            be performed by a paediatric eye doctor or a general optometrist. It
            is used to detect certain eye problems and conditions that are
            common in children such as lazy eye, astigmatism, myopia and
            hyperopia. Eye exams for children are similar to regular eye exams
            but include certain differences that cater to their needs such as
            their reading ability and demeanour. A kids’ eye doctor will ensure
            the child is comfortable and will make adjustments to the type of
            testing done in order to make sure your child’s eyes are examined no
            matter what stage of development they are at. There are many
            benefits to eye exams for children, such as early detection of
            certain eye diseases, advancement of their academic performance and
            overall improvement of the quality of life for children who have
            undiagnosed or misdiagnosed eye conditions.

                Eye exams for children are extremely important as they can
                detect early signs of eye conditions that may be mitigated or
                even reversed when caught at a young age. Children's vision is
                also a key source of their learning ability and performance in
                the classroom. According to ProVision Australia, vision is
                responsible for around 80% of all learning during a child’s
                first 12 years, therefore, children’s eye exams are extremely
                important in their development.
                <br /><br />
                According to The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, eye
                disorders are the most common long-term health issue experienced
                by children along with asthma and allergies. There are more than
                411,000 cases of long-term eye conditions among Australian
                children, most being shortsightedness and longsightedness. These
                Australian Institute of Health and Welfare statistics show just
                how important eye exams are for children in order to detect and
                treat eye conditions.

          <h2>What are the Different Tests Done in Eye Exams for Children?</h2>

          <p class="minusPadding">
            There are multiple different tests that are performed in eye exams
            for children to test their vision and eye health. The eye tests
            performed on children can be categorised into two different age
            groups, preschool children’s eye testing and older children’s eye
            testing. The definition of these two categories and their eye tests
            are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Pre-School Children's Eyes Testing:</b> Pre-school eye testing
              most often involves a vision screening test. Children do not need
              to be able to read letters to have an eye test as the eye care
              professional will adjust the exam for the individual child.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Older Children's Eye Testing:</b> Eye testing in older children
              is similar to adult eye tests and is important to ensure your
              child performs well in school as they may have undiagnosed eye
              conditions.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>1. Pre-school Children's Eyes Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Pre-school children’s eye testing typically includes kids aged 3-5
            and it is different from older children and adult eye exams as kids
            this age are unable to read, therefore they cannot be tested with
            the letter chart (Snellen chart). <br /><br />
            There are two different types of eye tests commonly used in
            pre-school children's eye tests. The first is a vision screening
            test and the second is a comprehensive eye exam. A vision screening
            test in Australia is provided by the government and is called the
            Statewide Eyesight Preschooler Screening or StEPS program. This
            program offers all 4-year-old children a free eye/vision screening
            test, which is a series of short tests and is used to identify if
            they have an eye condition but not determine what it is. A vision
            screening test is used to determine if the child needs a
            comprehensive eye exam. If they need an eye exam, this will most
            likely involve a visual acuity test, although using recognisable
            shapes instead of letters, a check of the alignment of their eyes, a
            refraction test and an eye health examination.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Older Children's Eye Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Older children’s eye testing is very similar to an adult eye exam
            with minor adjustments to ensure the child feels safe and
            comfortable. The room and test itself are made more engaging for
            your child’s convenience. The optometrist may test your child for
            specific conditions that adults do not get tested on. <br /><br />
            A typical eye test for older children will begin with the eye care
            professional asking questions about the child and their parent's
            visual family history. In many children’s eye tests, they will use
            easily recognisable shapes and pictures in place of letters on the
            LogMAR and Snellen chart. Older children may use the letter chart
            depending on their reading ability. Next, the child will have their
            colour vision tested as well as their visual field, ocular eye
            movements, and eye pressure. Further examination may occur to look
            for signs of short-sightedness, long-sightedness, lazy eye,
            astigmatism or turned eyes. The optometrist will also check the back
            of the eye for eye health issues. Finally, a digital photograph of
            your child’s eye may also be taken.

          <h2>What are the Benefits of Eye Exams for Children?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            There are many benefits of eye exams for children as it is a crucial
            part of taking care of their eye health which in turn improves their
            everyday life. The main benefits of eye exams for children are
            listed below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Early detection of serious eye diseases:</b> For both children
              and adults, diagnosing certain eye conditions early makes a
              significant difference in how they progress and the possibility of
              treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Your child might be unaware that their vision is impaired:</b>
              Getting an eye exam for your child can bring awareness to any
              vision issues they may not know are there. It can be difficult for
              children to know or understand that they have any vision
              impairment and issues as they may think it is normal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Academic performance improvement:</b> Eye exams for children
              can help diagnose vision issues and improve academic performance.
              Vision issues greatly impact your child’s academic performance
              especially if it affects their reading ability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Your child may face social difficulties at school:</b> Eye
              exams can detect any untreated eye conditions that may be
              affecting a child’s confidence and development, leading to
              difficulties at school.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Some children are misdiagnosed with vision problems:</b>
              Children with vision problems are often misdiagnosed with other
              behavioural problems which is why it is crucial to get their eyes
              tested.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>1. Early Detection of Serious Eye Diseases</h3>
          <p>
            Early detection of eye diseases, especially serious ones, is very
            crucial for children. Early treatment of eye conditions such as
            refractive errors and childhood cataracts is extremely important as
            in some cases the symptoms can be minimised or even reversed.
            Irreversal vision loss can sometimes be prevented if the issue is
            addressed early in its development. By booking your child into
            regular eye exams, an eye care professional may be able to identify
            certain eye conditions early enough that treatment is possible and
            effective.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Your Child Might be Unaware that their Vision is Impaired</h3>

          <p>
            Young children with an undiagnosed vision impairment are often
            unaware that they see differently than other children, believing
            that everyone else sees the same things they do. Children may not
            complain of abnormalities in their vision as they may think their
            eyesight is completely normal. Therefore, it is up to parents and
            school staff to recognise signs of vision impairment in children.
            <br /><br />
            Children can also find ways to compensate for their vision problems
            by working extra hard in school, leaving their parents and the child
            unaware that their vision is impaired. But with a comprehensive eye
            exam, an eye doctor can determine if the child is suffering from any
            eye conditions and make them more comfortable with corrective
            devices such as prescription glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Academic Performance Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            The improvement of academic performance is a major benefit of eye
            tests. School learning can be significantly hindered if your child
            has undiagnosed and untreated eye problems. Children rely heavily on
            their vision in the classroom, whether that’s looking at a
            whiteboard from a distance, reading books or writing. According to
            Clarendon Vision Development Center, at least 80% of a young child’s
            education is done through visual information. Also, a study
            conducted by Optometry Australia study in 2019, found that 1 in 5
            Australian children have an undetected vision problem. That is why
            is it crucial for children to have regular eye exams if they wish to
            achieve academic performance improvement.

              <h3>4. Your Child May Face Social Difficulties at School</h3>
              <p>
                If your children struggle with poor vision, they may face social
                difficulties at school. Undetected or untreated eye problems can
                also cause social issues for children. Children with poor vision
                often have fewer social interactions due to their inability to
                see adequately, leading them to be excluded from certain
                activities and by other children or avoid social interactions
                such as going to the movies with friends.

          <h3>5. Some Children are Misdiagnosed With Vision Problems</h3>
          <p>
            Misdiagnosed and therefore untreated eye conditions and vision
            problems lead to frustration with learning, negative self-image,
            discipline and behaviour issues and a slow rate of learning,
            according to the Canadian Association of Optometrists. In young
            children, certain eye conditions are misdiagnosed as behavioural
            disorders such as (ADD). Some eye conditions affect a child’s vision
            causing difficulty focusing and having them struggle to complete
            assignments.

          <h3>1. Astigmatism</h3>
          <p>
            Astigmatism is a refractive error that causes blurry vision due to
            the shape of the eye being more oval instead of round. According to
            the Boston Children’s Hospital, astigmatism is a common eye
            condition in infants but it most often clears on its own by the time
            the child reaches one year old. Eye astigmatism occurs when images
            in the eye are not focused on one point, due to the irregular shape
            of the cornea, lens or retina. The symptoms of astigmatism include
            blurry vision, eye strain, headaches and sensitivity to glare.
            Optometrists test for astigmatism during a comprehensive eye
            examination and treat it by prescribing glasses to give your child
            clear and comfortable vision.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Lazy Eye</h3>
          <p>
            Lazy eye, also known as amblyopia, occurs when a child is unable to
            see properly or at all out of one eye. It is caused by the brain
            favouring one eye, leading to the other eye becoming weaker. Lazy
            eyes are often the result of refractive errors short-sightedness,
            long-sightedness and astigmatism and also occur because of a squint.
            The symptoms of lazy eye include one eye being partially or fully
            shut, the head always tilted or turned to one side and one eye
            appearing turned in a different direction than the other. To treat
            lazy eye, an eye patch may be used to strengthen the weaker eye. A
            child can also do specialised exercises to treat lazy eye.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Squint</h3>
          <p>
            A squint is defined as the eyes appearing to look in different
            directions. A squint is common in babies although they usually
            outgrow this eye condition when they reach 6 months old. Squints
            occur when the eye muscles for each individual eye do not work in a
            balanced way. According to the Raising Children Network (Australia),
            the symptoms of a squint include eyes that turn in towards the nose
            or outwards. A squint may become more pronounced when a child has
            been outdoors, is unwell or tired, or if they are doing close-up
            activities such as reading. The treatment for a squint includes
            glasses, surgery or an eye patch.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Childhood Cataracts</h3>
          <p>
            Childhood cataracts is a rare eye condition and is often separated
            into two categories according to the National Health Service (NHS).
            The first category of childhood cataracts is congenital cataracts,
            which present when the baby is born or soon after birth. The second
            is developmental, infantile or juvenile cataracts which is diagnosed
            in children and older babies. The symptoms of childhood cataracts
            include poor vision, a squint and cloudy patches in the lens.
            Cataracts in children are caused by many reasons, some include an
            eye injury, a genetic fault inherited from a parent and certain
            genetic conditions. The treatment for childhood cataracts includes
            surgery or, if it is not too serious, the condition may have little
            effect on the vision requiring no treatment.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Long-sightedness</h3>
          <p>
            Also known as hyperopia, long-sightedness is a refractive error that
            causes people to struggle to see nearby objects. The symptoms of
            long-sightedness include eye squinting, eye strain, headaches and
            difficulty reading small print. Long-sightedness occurs because
            light entering the eye does not focus properly, rather it focuses
            behind the retina, as opposed to on the retina. Treatment for
            hyperopia for children includes corrective lenses. Although,
            according to the Raising Children Network (Australia), if the child
            has mild long-sightedness, they may not need treatment as the eyes
            sometimes naturally adjust to see clearly.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Short-sightedness</h3>
          <p>
            Also known as myopia, short-sightedness is a condition in which the
            eye struggles to focus on objects at a far distance.
            Short-sightedness occurs when light entering the eye does not focus
            on the retina properly, leading to symptoms such as headaches, eye
            strain, blurry distance vision, squinting and struggling to see far
            away objects. This refractive error is treated with prescription
            glasses. The lenses used to correct myopia will be concave in shape,
            helping the light that enters the eye to focus on the retina. Laser
            eye surgery is also an option, however, this is not recommended for
            children.

              <h3>7. Colour Vision Deficiency</h3>
              <p>
                Colour vision deficiency, also referred to as colour blindness,
                is an eye condition that causes people to have difficulty seeing
                certain colours or, they may see colours in a different way than
                other people. Colour vision deficiency is a more accurate term
                than colour blindness, as those with this condition, while they
                cannot see all colours, are not completely blind to colour. Red
                and green and their components are the most common colours that
                people with colour vision deficiency are unable to see. The
                symptoms of colour vision include difficulty identifying
                different colours and trouble separating colours. In children,
                parents may identify the symptoms of this eye condition when
                their children are learning to name colours. Treatment is not
                usually an option for colour vision deficiency as there are few
                limitations for this condition. It is common for people to only
                find out they have colour vision deficiency until they are in
                adulthood.

            Children?
          </h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            There are three different types of eye doctors that perform eye
            exams for children. These eye care professionals include
            optometrists, ophthalmologists and orthoptists. The definitions of
            the eye doctors for children are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Optometrists (OD):</b> Optometrists perform comprehensive eye
              exams, prescribe prescriptions for glasses and treat certain eye
              conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ophthalmologists (MD):</b> Ophthalmologists treat serious eye
              conditions and has a medical degree in order to perform surgery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Orthoptists (CO):</b> Orthoptists care for patients with eye
              disorders and can specialise in children’s vision and paediatrics.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>1. Optometrists (OD)</h3>
          <p>
            Optometrists are eye care professionals whose main responsibilities
            include performing comprehensive eye tests, prescribing corrective
            devices such as glasses and diagnosing and detecting certain eye
            disorders. Optometrists are able to refer patients to
            ophthalmologists when they are faced with more advanced and serious
            eye conditions they are not trained to treat.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Ophthalmologists (MD)</h3>
          <p>
            Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who have specialised training
            in eye health. Ophthalmologists assess, manage and treat eye
            conditions that are beyond the expertise of an optometrist, such as
            advanced glaucoma. Ophthalmologists also provide eye surgery. A
            child may be referred to an ophthalmologist if they have an eye
            issue that requires more advanced care than an optometrist can
            provide.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Orthoptists (CO)</h3>
          <p>
            Orthoptists are eye care professionals who provide services for
            patients with eye disorders. They play an important role in
            detecting, diagnosing and managing eye diseases in both children and
            adults. Orthoptists often specialise in a range or different areas
            such as children’s vision and paediatrics, cataract care and retinal
            disorders.

          <h3>How Often Should My Child Have an Eye Exam?</h3>
          <p>
            A child should have an eye exam when you suspect there may be issues
            with their vision, just before they start school, at the parents'
            discretion and at the suggestion of an optometrist. Once they start
            school, it is recommended that children should get regular eye tests
            and see an optometrist once every two years. It is important for
            your child to have regular eye exams, as an optometrist will detect
            whether they need a prescription for glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Is There a Way to Protect and Keep Your Children's Eyes Healthy?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes, there are many ways to protect and keep your child’s eyes
            healthy. The main way to protect your child’s eyes is to ensure they
            have regular eye tests and take them to an eye care professional if
            you notice any changes in their vision. As has been discussed in
            this article, children’s eyesight impacts much of their life,
            especially in school.
            <br /><br />
            Other ways parents can protect their children’s eye health is to be
            aware of any family history of eye diseases, and ensure they are
            spending time outdoors as this can lower their risk of certain eye
            conditions such as myopia. It is important that when they are
            outdoors, children are wearing sunglasses as exposure to UV rays can
            lead to the development of serious eye conditions later in life.
            Follow the advice of your eye care professional, especially if they
            prescribe glasses for your child. Limit their screen time to two
            hours a day and ensure they get proper nutrition as it will not only
            improve their eye health but their overall health.
