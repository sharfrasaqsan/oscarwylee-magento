      Best Glasses for Diamond Face (Male and Female): Frames, Shapes and Types
    </h1>

    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content">
        The best glasses for a diamond face are rectangle, square, butterfly,
        oval, round and cat-eye, as these frame shapes help to soften sharp,
        contoured features, bringing balance to the strong structure of this
        face shape.
        <br /><br />
        A diamond shaped face is characterised by its narrow forehead and
        prominent cheekbones, tapering down into a narrow jawline and pointed
        chin. The cheekbones are the widest point of a diamond face. The
        features of a diamond shaped face are defined and structured. The frame
        shapes that are the best fit for a diamond face are ones that help to
        soften the sharp features and contours of the face, helping to balance
        out its strong structure. The best diamond face glasses are ones that
        bring attention to the upper part of the face, helping to widen the
        forehead and bring new proportions to the face. Diamond glasses for a
        diamond face are not recommended as they add to the sharp structure of
        the face shape, over-emphasising the hard contours.
        <br /><br />
        The best glasses for a diamond face, female, male, or any gender, are
        rectangle, square, butterfly, oval, round and cat-eye. The benefits of
        these frame shapes and why they suit a diamond face, are listed below.

      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Rectangle glasses:</span>
          Rectangle glasses seem like a contradictory frame choice when the aim
          is to soften the features of a diamond face. However, a rectangular
          frame with softer angles will help to complement the face’s natural
          contours and add width and balance to the top of the face.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Square glasses:</span> Square glasses that
          have a thin frame or softer corners, such as a squared aviator frame,
          or navigator frames, complement and highlight the face’s natural
          contour. Square glasses will bring attention to the brow area and help
          balance out a diamond face.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Butterfly glasses:</span> Butterfly frames,
          designed to mimic the shape of a butterfly wing, have curved edges,
          with the top rim gently arched. The curved design of butterfly glasses
          brings a softness to the features of a diamond face and helps to give
          it balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Oval glasses:</span> Oval shaped frames help
          to bring a softness to the sharp, contoured features of a diamond face
          shape.

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Round glasses:</span> Round frames help to
          bring curves to the straight, sharp structure of a diamond face,

          <span class="list-title">Cat-eye glasses:</span> Cat-eye shaped frames

          <h2 class="subtitle">1. Rectangular Glasses for a Diamond Face</h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            Rectangle glasses for a diamond face seem like a contradictory
            choice of eyewear, as a diamond face usually benefits from rounded
            frames to soften the features. However, if a rectangle glasses frame
            has just the right amount of angles, it is effective in
            complementing the features of a diamond face, without enhancing the
            sharp and contoured structure. A rectangle glasses shape for a
            diamond face, refers to a frame that has lenses wider than they are
            tall. The frame is structured and angular in its design.
            <br /><br />
            Rectangle glasses frames help to complement the angles of a diamond
            shaped face, without bringing out too many sharp edges. A diamond
            face shape is characterised by its narrow forehead, wide, defined
            cheeks and narrow chin, tapered into a point. This structure gives
            the face a sharp and contoured look. The right angles of a
            rectangular frame help to complement these facial features, without
            over-emphasising them. Rectangle frames will not completely
            eliminate the appearance of the contours of a diamond face, like a
            round frame, but gently highlight and complement them. Additionally,
            a rectangle frame helps to draw attention to the eye and forehead
            area of a diamond face, giving it width and providing the face with
            balance.
            <br /><br />
            Rectangle frames are a clean, classic and simple design, making them
            a long time staple in the eyewear industry. Rectangle frames are a
            versatile eyewear frame that work for casual and formal outings,
            transitioning well from day to night. The enduring popularity of
            rectangle glasses means they are well suited to any season, summer
            or winter, bringing simple sophistication to a look all year round.
            <br /><br />
            Rectangle frames are suitable for all genders. Regardless of whether
            the face is more masculine or more feminine presenting, rectangle
            frames have the same enhancing benefits. Rectangle glasses for men
            with a diamond face help to complement the contours of the face and
            highlight the face's best features. Rectangle glasses for women with
            a diamond face bring attention to the forehead and eyes, widening
            these areas and bringing more balance to the facial structure.

          <p class="para-content">
            Square glasses for a diamond face seem like a contradictory eyewear
            choice, as rounded glasses are usually a better option for helping
            to soften the features and bring balance to a diamond face. However,
            square shaped glasses that have a thin frame or softer corners, such
            as a squared aviator frame, help to complement and balance the
            features of a diamond face shape. A square glasses frame for a
            diamond face, describes a pair of glasses with lenses that are of a
            similar width and height.
            <br /><br />
            Square frames with a thin frame and softer curves, such as the
            squared aviator or navigator frame, highlight and complement the
            natural contours and sharpness of diamond face shape, such as the
            strong jaw and cheeks, gently softening them. A square glasses shape
            for a diamond face, also helps to bring attention to the forehead
            and eye area. A diamond face shape will have a narrow forehead area.
            By widening the forehead, square frames bring new dimensions to the
            face.
            <br /><br />
            Square glasses are a simple and classic frame shape, a popular
            choice among glasses wearers. The simple, clean and strong design of
            a square frame shape, means that they are widely wearable by anyone
            for any occasion, day or night. The enduring popularity of square
            glasses ensures that the wearer will be on trend all year round,
            through the summer and winter seasons.
            <br /><br />
            The simple design of square glasses suits all faces, whether more
            feminine or masculine presenting. Square glasses for men with a
            diamond face work to bring balance and contour to the face. Square
            glasses for women with a diamond face are good for balancing the
            face, lengthening and highlighting the facial features.

          <h2 class="subtitle">3. RButterfly Glasses for a Diamond Face</h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            Butterfly glasses for a diamond face are a unique and edgy choice of
            eyewear that help add balance to this face shape and soften the
            features. A butterfly glasses frame for a diamond face, describes a
            pair of glasses that are designed to mimic the wings of a butterfly.
            Butterfly glasses have a gently rounded frame, with the outside
            edges larger in height than the inside edges. The top rim of a
            butterfly frame swoops into a thicker upper corner.
            <br /><br />
            Butterfly glasses are one of the best frame shape choices for a
            diamond face, as the round design and soft curves help to soften the
            features and bring structure to the face. Diamond shaped faces have
            narrow foreheads, with the cheekbones the widest and most prominent
            facial feature. A butterfly glasses shape for a diamond face, brings
            attention to the forehead, emphasising the eyes. This in turn widens
            the appearance of the upper area of the face and brings some new
            proportions. Butterfly glasses help to give a diamond shape more
            dimension and new structure. The curves and gentle round shape of
            the frame works to soften some of the sharp, defined features of a
            diamond face such as the jaw, and bring balance.
            <br /><br />
            Butterfly glasses are a delicate and sophisticated retro frame shape
            that complement any outfit whether a daytime, casual look or a night
            time, formal outfit. The simple design comes in a range of colours
            and styles, suitable for winter and summer seasons.
            <br /><br />
            The design of a butterfly frame may be more feminine, however,
            butterfly frames work to bring balance and soften the face, no
            matter whether the face is masculine or feminine. Butterfly glasses
            for men with a diamond face work to highlight the eyes and bring
            attention to the forehead, bringing more dimension to the face.
            Butterfly glasses for women with a diamond face help to soften the
            sharp and contoured features of this face shape.

            Oval glasses for a diamond face are a great choice of frame, as the

            than they are tall.
            <br /><br />
            Oval glasses are a great choice for diamond faces, as the curves of
            the frame help to bring softness to the sharp, defined features of
            this face shape. Diamond faces have narrow foreheads, wide, defined
            cheekbones and narrow chins, giving a sharp and pointed look to the
            face. The oval glasses shape for a diamond face is beneficial as the
            circular design helps to soften these features. The curved edges
            take away from the cheeks’ sharp contour and even out the harsh
            lines and edges. In addition to this, oval eyeglasses for a diamond
            face work to bring new dimensions to the face. The circular design

            features.
            <br /><br />

          <p class="para-content">
            Round glasses for a diamond face are one of the most popular eyewear
            choices, as they contrast the sharp features and harsh lines of this
            face shape. Round glasses for a diamond face shape refers to a frame
            that is circular in nature, with rounded edges.
            <br /><br />
            A round glasses shape for a diamond face helps to bring softness to
            sharp, contoured features. This in turn, alters the proportions of
            the face and provides balance. A diamond face shape is
            distinguishable by its narrow forehead, wide cheekbones and narrow
            chin. The curves of a round frame shape, help to soften the
            appearance of the narrow, hard lines of the jaw, as well as the
            sharp cheekbones. By softening the jaw and the cheeks in this way,
            round glasses help to bring a new dimension to the face. By breaking
            up some of the contour and lines of a diamond face shape, a round
            glasses frame helps to bring balance to the face.
            <br /><br />
            Round glasses are a hugely popular frame, as they are a simple and
            versatile design. Round glasses pair well with any outfit, whether
            casual or formal and are suitable for both day and night time
            events. The simplicity and neutrality of the round frame design
            means that it is a fashionable eyewear choice all year round, in
            both the summer and winter seasons.
            <br /><br />
            The simplicity and neutral design of round shaped glasses make them
            a good frame choice for everyone, any gender, whether the face is
            more feminine or masuline. Round glasses for women with a diamond
            face help to soften the jaw and cheeks and bring balance to the
            face. Round glasses for men with a diamond face help add a new
            dimension to the contoured, hard lines of this face shape and give a
            more proportioned look.

          <h2 class="subtitle">6. Cat-eye Glasses for a Diamond Face</h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            Cat-eye glasses for a diamond face are a stylish and fun choice of
            eyewear that help accentuate the eye and forehead area, bringing
            balance to the face. Cat-eye glasses for a diamond face, describe a
            frame that is designed to mimic that of a cat’s eye. The frame is
            curved in design, swooping up in the corners.
            <br /><br />
            A cat-eye glasses shape for a diamond face is a good choice of
            eyewear as the upswept corners bring attention to the forehead and
            eye area. A diamond face shape has a narrow forehead, defined cheeks
            and a chin that tapers into a point. A cat-eye glasses frame helps
            to highlight the upper portion of the face and widen the typically
            narrow forehead and eye area, giving the face new dimension and more
            balance. The circular design of cat-eye frames softens the features.
            The curved frame lessens the contoured appearance of the jaw and
            cheeks, bringing additional balance to the face.
            <br /><br />
            Cat-eye glasses have been a popular frame shape since the 50s, with
            many celebrities and Hollywood icons such as Audrey Hepburn
            popularising the style. Cat-eye frames have remained a staple
            eyewear accessory, fashionable all year round, through the summer
            and winter seasons. The feline design complements both casual and
            formal outfits.
            <br /><br />
            Though cat-eye glasses are a more feminine looking frame, the design
            works to soften and balance the features of any face, no matter
            whether the face is more feminine or masculine. Cat-eye glasses for
            women with a diamond face help to soften the appearance of sharp
            features such as the jaw and the cheeks and bring balance to the
            face. Cat-eye glasses for men with a diamond face help to bring
            attention to the eyes, browline and forehead, helping to open up and
            widen this area.

                <li>
                  Some cat-eye frames are undersized in design, or large and
                  oversized.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Neither oversized or undersized are a good choice of eyewear
                  for diamond faces as they affect the facial proportions.
                  Undersized frames make a diamond face look wider, whilst
                  oversized frames make the features look bunched up.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When buying cat-eye eyeglasses for a diamond face, pick a size
                  that is proportionate to your face and features.

            What are the Best Glasses Colours for Diamond Faces?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            The best glasses colour for diamond faces are darker colours around
            the top rim, or a lighter colour around the whole frame, to help
            soften the features and provide balance to a face. The main things
            to consider when picking glasses for a diamond face shape, is that
            the frame helps to contrast the defined lines and sharp features of
            this face shape. Rectangle, square, cat-eye, oval and round frames
            are among the best frame shapes to do this and the colour that they
            come in helps to further enhance these effects.
            <br /><br />
            A glasses frame for a diamond face benefits from having a darker
            upper rim, as this helps to draw attention to the eyes and forehead
            area. A dark upper rim will balance out the hard lines and sharp,
            contoured structures of a diamond face. A lighter colour, especially
            near the bottom of a frame, helps to soften the appearance of the
            wide, defined cheekbones and bring balance to the face. Patterned
            frame designs such as tortoise shell and floral print, are an
            additional good choice for diamond faces.
            <br /><br />
            The benefits of darker top rim glasses or prints such as tortoise
            shell being ideal for diamond face shapes, is that these colours and
            patterns work for any gender and can be paired with a variety of
            looks, casual or formal.
            <br /><br />
            Other considerations when picking a glasses colour for a diamond
            face shape is individual skin tone, hair colour and eye colour, as
            these can affect how a pair of glasses will look. It is important to
            remember however, that these are only suggestions. You should
            express your personal style and individuality with whatever colour
            you like best.

              The best glasses for women with a diamond face are butterfly,

              to soften the sharper features of a diamond face, such as the
              cheeks and jawline, and bring balance to the facial structure.

            What are the Best Sunglasses for Diamond Faces?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            The best sunglasses for diamond shaped faces are oval, cat-eye,
            aviator and browline, as these frames help to soften sharp and
            contoured features like the jaw and the cheeks, bringing balance to
            the strong structure of this face shape. Oval, cat-eye, aviator and
            browline glasses have good sized lenses, which help protect your
            eyes. The best sunglasses for a diamond face are slightly different
            from the best optical glasses, as sunglasses have the additional
            task of protecting your eyes from the sun and UV rays. This means
            that the best sunglasses frame shape is one that effectively covers
            the eyes. The best sunglasses for a round face shape are listed
            below.
          </p>
          <ol class="ordered-list">
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Oval sunglasses: </span>Like oval optical
              glasses, oval sunglasses are a good choice of eyewear for a
              diamond shaped face, as the curves of the frame help to soften the
              features and bring new dimension to the face. Oval sunglasses come
              in many designs and sizes, providing the coverage needed to help
              protect your eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Cat-eye sunglasses: </span>Cat-eye
              sunglasses are beneficial for diamond faces as the swooped upper
              corners help to bring attention to the forehead and eye area,
              widening these more narrow features and bringing more balance to
              the face. Cat-eye sunglasses are an enduring fashion accessory, on
              trend throughout all seasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Aviator sunglasses: </span>Aviator
              sunglasses are a great choice of eyewear for diamond faces as the
              curved, tear-drop style of these glasses helps to soften the sharp
              and contoured features of this face shape. The aviator lens shape
              is designed to cover as much of the eye as possible for maximum
              sun protection. Aviator sunglasses are another enduring style of
              sunglasses, fashionable for any occasion or season.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Browline sunglasses: </span>Browline
              sunglasses describe a frame in which the top half of the frame rim
              is darker, and thicker than the bottom. A browline frame helps to
              bring attention to the upper portion of a diamond face and balance
              out the wider cheekbones and tapered chin. The shape of the lenses
              in a browline frame, oval or rectangle, help to give good coverage
              and protect your eyes from the sun.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="para-content">
            The colour choice when picking sunglasses for a diamond shaped face
            are important. Darker colours like blacks or browns, particularly
            near the top of the frame, make the sunglasses stand out on the top
            half of the face, drawing attention away from the cheeks and tapered
            chin. This helps to bring some new dimension to the face. Patterns
            like tortoise shell and floral work with a diamond shaped face.
            <br /><br />
            Cat-eye is generally considered a more feminine frame, however, its
            powerful ability to shape the upper portion of the face works just
            as well on a masculine face as it does a feminine face. Cat-eye,
            browline, oval and aviator sunglasses all work on feminine and
            masculine faces, helping to soften the features and bring balance to
            the face, whilst providing adequate eye coverage for sun and UV ray
            protection.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, most of our glasses frames can be made into
            sunglasses, prescription or non-prescription.

            What are the Glasses that are Not Good for Diamond Face Shape?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            The glasses that are not suitable for a diamond face shape are
            undersized glasses, oversized glasses or those that are overly sharp
            and angular. These frames alter the dimensions of the face in a way
            that is not as flattering as some other frame shapes. The frame
            shapes that are not recommended for diamond shaped faces are listed
            below.
          </p>
          <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li>
              <span class="list-title"> Oversized glasses:</span> Oversized
              glasses make the features of a diamond face appear very close
              together, narrowing the forehead and the jawline. When picking
              glasses for diamond face shapes, the goal is to balance the face.
              An oversized frame will not achieve this balanced look, making
              features that should be widened appear smaller.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Undersized glasses:</span> Undersized
              glasses distort the proportions of a diamond face by making it
              appear wide. A diamond face shape is characterised by its wide,
              defined cheeks, which an undersized frame accentuates, giving
              width to areas of the face that should be minimised.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Sharp, angular glasses:</span> Some
              angles on a diamond face, such as those from a rectangular frame,
              help to complement sharp features, however, too many angles or an
              overly defined frame, overemphasise the contoured lines. This
              makes the face appear harsher in structure.

            How to Understand Whether You Have a Diamond face or Not?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            To find out whether you have a diamond face, you need to measure the
            face and consider the characteristics of your facial features. To
            find out the shape of a face when measuring it, there are four main
            areas to estimate; the forehead, the cheekbones, the jaw line and
            the length of the face from chin to hairline. If the cheeks are the
            widest part of your face, with the forehead narrow, the jawline
            narrow, and the chin tapering to a point, you have a diamond face
            shape. The features of a diamond face shape are sharp and contoured.
            The forehead of someone with a diamond shaped face is smaller than a
            person with a heart shaped face.

              <ol class="ordered-list">
                <li>
                  Measure the length of your face from the tip of the chin to

                <li>
                  Measure the width of your face, across the forehead, the
                  cheeks and the jawline. If your cheeks are the widest part of
                  your face, with your jawline significantly smaller and the
                  forehead also narrow, you have a diamond shaped face.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should next consider the defining characteristics of a
                  diamond face and if you have these features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consider: Is your face sharp and contoured, is your jawline
                  tapered into a point, are your forehead and hairline narrow?
                  If the answer to these questions are yes, you may have a
                  diamond shaped face.

            How to Choose Best Glasses for Different Face Shapes?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            The way to choose the best glasses for different face shapes, is to
            pick a frame that complements the unique features and structure of
            that face shape. A frame should work at emphasising certain areas of
            the face, drawing attention away from other features, to create
            balance. Just like with a diamond face shape, other face shapes such
            as round, oval and rectangle have a frame shape that is best suited
            to their facial features and structure.
            <br /><br />
            Once a person has determined what face shape they have, they will be
            aware what areas of the face to highlight, what features to contour
            or what areas need some proportioning.
            <br /><br />
            When picking a frame for your face shape, consider the following:
          </p>
          <ol class="ordered-list hightlight-list">
            <li>
              Pick a frame shape that highlights areas that need to be brought
              forwards or lifted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose a glasses frame that balances the proportions of your face.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pick a frame colour that helps emphasise the enhancing features of
              your glasses.
            </li>
          </ol>

            What are the Other Accessories for Diamond Faces along with Glasses?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            The other accessories for a diamond face alongside glasses, include
            jewellery such as earrings and necklaces, and hair accessories. A
            diamond face is characterised by a narrow forehead, wide cheeks and
            tapered chin. The best accessories for a diamond face are those that
            help to soften the features, reduce attention to the jawline and
            widen the forehead area to balance out the face. Earrings that drop
            down and have curves, such as hoop earrings, help to soften the
            sharp features like the jawline and cheeks. Medium length necklaces
            help draw attention up towards the forehead and cheeks. Hair
            accessories such as bands and clips, should be put to the side of a
            diamond face to help give more width to the eyes and the forehead
            area, and balance out the face.

            Does the Best Glasses for Diamond Faces Change From Year to Year?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            The best glasses for diamond faces do not change from year to year.
            The best glasses for diamond faces in 2022 are rectangle, square,
            cat-eye, oval and round glasses, the same glasses that have always
            been popular for this face shape. Glasses, whilst an important
            optical tool to help people see, are also considered a fashion
            piece. Fashion items tend to come and go in terms of popularity. The
            best glasses for diamond faces however, are all classic styles that
            have endured in popularity. The simple designs of rectangle, square,
            cat-eye, oval and round glasses have solidified them as staples in
            the fashion and optical worlds. Cat-eye glasses for example, first
            gained popularity in the 50s, and remain a major fashion piece
            today.

            What are the Other Face Shapes for Glasses Besides Diamond?
          </h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            There are several other face shapes for glasses besides a diamond.
            The other face shapes for glasses include round, oval, pear and
            heart shaped faces. Each face shape is unique, and will have frames
            that are the most complementary and flattering for that shape.
          </p>
          <ol class="ordered-list">
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Round face shape:</span> A round face
              shape is circular in nature, characterised by its softer features,
              smooth lines, full cheeks and wide cheekbones. The best glasses
              for a round face are square, rectangle and cat-eye as they help to
              bring angle and structure to the face.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Oval face shape:</span> An oval face
              shape is similar to a round face shape in that it is circular or
              rounder in nature. However, an oval face is thinner than a round
              face. An oval face is longer than it is wide. The best glasses for
              an oval face shape are rectangle, square and cat-eye glasses as
              they help to cut the fullness of this face shape and give it some
              structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">Pear face shape:</span> A pear face shape
              is characterised by a narrow forehead, cheekbones slightly bigger
              than the forehead and a wide, broad jawline. This face shape
              resembles a triangle. The best glasses for a pear face are
              cat-eye, round and rectangle glasses as they help draw attention
              to the eyes and balance out the fuller jaw.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-title">DHeart face shape:</span> A heart shaped
              face resembles an inverted or upside down triangle, with a wide
              forehead area and a pointed chin, with high cheekbones. The best
              glasses for a heart shaped face are oval, rounded and aviator, as
              the curves in these frames help to soften sharp features, as well
              as bring width to the eye area. This helps to balance out the
              width of the forehead and hairline.
