      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Discuss with your optometrist:</span>
          When choosing contact lenses, you will need to discuss your options
          with an optometrist who can provide advice on what contacts may be
          best for your lifestyle and prescription.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">How often you wear them:</span>
          How often you are planning to wear your contacts can impact your
          choice as there are types such as rigid gas permeable contacts that
          need to be worn daily to remain comfortable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Prescription needs:</span>
          Your prescription can determine what type of contact lenses you need.
          For example, if you need vision correction for multiple refractive
          errors you may need multifocal (progressive) contacts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Daily or extended wear contacts:</span>
          There are two main types of contacts in terms of wear schedule, which
          are daily wear or extended wear. Daily wear are worn during the day
          and taken out at night. Extended wear can be worn in the day and
          overnight for one to multiple nights in a row depending on the
          specific type.

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Great for sports:</span>
          Contact lenses are a great option for people who play sports and are
          involved in other forms of physical activity as they do not get in the
          way or are at risk of falling off your face. Wearing glasses when
          playing sports can be dangerous and could damage a person’s eyes if
          you get hit in the face.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Natural field of view:</span>
          Wearing contacts provides a natural field of view as they are placed
          directly on the eye rather than over them like glasses. Therefore,
          there is less obstruction as the contacts move with your eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Less likely to get dirty or smudged:</span>
          Contact lenses are less likely to get dirty or smudged than glasses as
          they rest in the eye and are not touched by the hands throughout the
          day. It is important to clean your contact lenses as directed however
          as they may still collect dirt and debris.

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Dry eyes:</span>
          Wearing contact lenses may increase the risk of developing dry eyes
          due to the increased friction between the eye and the contact lens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Eye infection:</span>
          Contact lenses may lead to the development of an eye infection known
          as keratitis, which can occur as a result of an eye injury or wearing
          contact lenses for extended periods of time, which can lead to a
          build-up of protein deposits and debris.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">High-maintenance:</span>
          Contact lenses require high-maintenance care to ensure they are stored
          properly and cleaned well before and after use. It is important to
          follow a specific consistent cleaning regimen to prevent eye
          infections and general discomfort in the eye.
