                  <b>Get a Regular Eye Test:</b><br />Getting a regular eye test
                  is an important way to keep on top of your eye health. A
                  regular eye test allows your optometrist to track any changes
                  to your eye and give treatment for vision issues if needed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Quit Smoking:</b><br />Quitting smoking can be hugely
                  helpful in keeping your eyesight healthy. Smoking can greatly
                  increase your risk of developing eye conditions such as age
                  related macular degeneration. By quitting, you lower your risk
                  of developing these conditions.

                <b>Limit Screen Time:</b><br />By limiting your screen time or
                taking breaks when looking at screens for a long time, you help
                keep your eyesight healthy. Screen time has been connected to
                issues such as eye strain, eye fatigue and disruptions to
                sleeping patterns.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Use Safety Eyewear:</b><br />It is important to use safety
                eyewear, such as safety glasses or goggles, if you are working
                in an environment in which debris, or other hazardous materials
                such as vapour and chemicals may touch the eye. Using safety
                eyewear protects the eyes and maintains eye health.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Keep the Germs Away:</b><br />Keeping germs away from your
                eyes and maintaining good eye hygiene, is important in helping
                to keep your eyes and eyesight healthy. Not touching the eyes
                with dirty hands, not using old makeup, and regularly cleaning
                glasses helps to keep the germs away from your eyes.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Wear Your Glasses:</b><br />Wearing your glasses helps to
                protect your eyesight and give your eyes the vision assistance
                they need.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Tell Someone if Your Vision Changes:</b><br />It is important
                to tell someone like your optometrist or your doctor, if you
                experience any changes to your vision. These health care
                practitioners will be able to assess your eyes and detect any
                potential issues that are causing the vision problems, helping
                to keep you and your eyes healthy.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Stay Physically Active:</b><br />Staying physically active is
                an important part of taking care of not just your eye health but
                your overall health. Staying fit and active reduces risk of
                health issues, including cardiovascular and blood vessel related
                issues, that cause symptoms in the eye.

                Keeping a healthy and balanced diet is a great way to keep your
                eyes and eyesight healthy. A healthy and balanced diet is
                described as a diet that is high in whole foods, fruits and
                vegetables, healthy fats and proteins. A healthy and balanced
                diet is one that is low in saturated fats and added sugar,
                however, people are generally safe to consume these in small
                amounts.
                <br /><br />
                Keeping a healthy and balanced diet is good for your whole body
                and overall health, as well as being of huge benefit to the eye.
                By eating well, you give your body the fuel it needs, help to
                boost immunity and help to reduce your risk of health conditions
                such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other blood vessel
                related issues, which affect the eye. If people do not maintain
                a healthy and balanced diet, they put themselves at higher risk
                of chronic disease, obesity, and other health conditions such as
                cancers. If you do not eat well, then your eyes do not receive
                the nutrients needed for optimal function.

            In addition to keeping a healthy and balanced diet, research has
            shown that there are certain specific foods that have minerals and
            vitamins that specifically help with eye health, helping to reduce
            the risk of vision issues such as cataracts. According to Havard
            Health, vitamins, A, C, E, the mineral zinc and the omega-3 fatty
            acid DHA, may help maintain good eyesight and eye health. Foods that
            are good for keeping the eye healthy include fish, nuts, seeds,
            leafy greens, yellow and orange fruits. These foods help to protect
            the various structures of the eye and help prevent eye diseases such
            as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.

          <h2>2. Get a regular eye test</h2>
          <p>
            Getting a regular eye test is one of the most important tips for
            maintaining the health of eyes and eyesight. An eye test is defined
            as a procedure in which an optometrist, or other eye care
            professional, will check the health of your eye and assess your
            eyesight. An eye test involves several exams such as a tonometry
            test which measures intraocular eye pressure and a refraction test
            in which an optometrist checks the quality of your vision.
            <br /><br />
            An eye test is an important part of maintaining eye health as it
            allows your optometrist to diagnose any vision issues such as
            hyperopia and astigmatism, or eye diseases such as glaucoma or
            cataracts. Getting a regular eye test means that these conditions
            can be caught early on, so they do not become a bigger problem
            later.
            <br /><br />
            If a person does not keep up with their regular eye exams, they risk
            not detecting a potential eye disease or vision issue. Some eye
            conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), do not
            show symptoms until the later stages of the disease. That’s why,
            even if you feel like you have clear vision, it is important to get
            regular eye tests.
            <br /><br />
            Oscar Wylee recommends that those under 65 get a regular eye test
            every 2 years. People over 65 should get them annually or as
            recommended by their optometrist. Those with health conditions such
            as diabetes or with existing eye issues such as cataracts, need eye
            tests more regularly. Your optometrist will discuss with you how
            frequent your eye tests should be.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Quit Smoking</h2>
          <p>
            Quitting smoking is a major way to potentially improve eye health
            and eyesight. Smoking refers to the practice of consuming tobacco
            through use of cigarettes. Smoking is scientifically proven to be
            bad for your overall health, and this includes your eye health.
            Smoking has been shown to cause damage to various parts of the eye
            including the retina and the macula. Smoking has been linked to an
            increased risk of several eye diseases, including age-related
            macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts and general eye functionality.
            <br /><br />
            According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), those who
            smoke are between two to three times more likely to develop
            cataracts than a non-smoker. People who smoke are also up to four
            times more likely to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
            than non-smokers.
            <br /><br />
            Quitting smoking is a major step towards improving your eye health,
            and eyesight. By not smoking, you reduce your risk of developing, or
            worsening, any eye diseases and vision issues.

          <h2>4. Limit Screen Time</h2>
          <p>
            Limiting screen time is one of the best tips for maintaining the
            health of your eye and eyesight. Screen time is described as time
            spent looking at a digital screen, whether this is a computer, a
            laptop, the TV or a smartphone. Long periods of screen time have
            been linked to negative effects on the eyes, including digital eye
            strain, eye fatigue and dry eyes.
            <br /><br />
            The blue light that is found in digital screens has also been linked
            to negative affects on the eyes. Blue light is a type of light that
            is produced naturally from the sun. Blue light can also be
            artificial and is used in digital screens such as laptops, computers
            and phones. Whilst there is currently limited scientific evidence
            that suggests blue light has any long-term effects on the eyes,
            according to UAB Medicine, laboratory evidence on animals has
            suggested that blue light may harm the retinal cells. Blue light has
            also been linked to sleep disruption in humans. According to a study
            published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
            (PNAS), conducted by Chang, Aeschbach, Duffy and Czeisler, people
            that go on digital devices before bed, release smaller amounts of
            melatonin, which is the chemical that helps us sleep.
            <br /><br />
            By limiting screen time or taking breaks when looking at screens for
            a long time, you help to keep your eyesight healthy. If people are
            required to be on digital devices for extended periods of time,
            there are ways to protect the eyes. Use the 20/20/20 rule which
            suggests that for every 20 minutes of screen time, you look away for
            20 seconds and focus your eyes on something 20 feet away. There are
            blue light blocking glasses which may help to block blue light that
            enters the eye and reduce digital eye strain and sleep disruptions.
          </p>

          <h2 class="addTopMargin">5. Wear Your Shades</h2>
          <p>
            Wearing your shades, or your sunglasses, is a great way to maintain
            the health of your eyes and eyesight. Sunglasses are a type of
            eyewear that is designed to protect the eyes from ultraviolet or UV
            light that comes from the sun. UV light has been shown to cause
            damage to the eyes, including the cornea, the lens, the retina and
            the eyelid.
            <br /><br />
            According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, long term
            exposure to UV light increases the risk of developing eye conditions
            such as cataracts and eye cancers. Retinal degeneration and
            non-cancerous growths such as pterygium, have been linked to
            prolonged UV light exposure.
            <br /><br />
            It is important when buying sunglasses that you consider how much
            protection they have. According to the Cancer Council of Australia,
            there are 4 categories of protection when it comes to sunglasses,
            with category 4 being the best.
            <br /><br />
            Just like the skin, the eyes need protection from the sun. By
            wearing sunglasses, you can help to protect your eyes from damaging
            UV rays and maintain the health of your eyes and eyesight.
            Sunglasses are also a good way to protect your eyes from the
            elements whilst outside such as harsh winds, and debris.

          <h2>6. Use Safety Eyewear</h2>
          <p>
            Using safety eyewear, such as safety glasses, is an important tip
            for keeping your eyes and eyesight healthy. Safety eyewear is
            defined as any type of eyewear that keeps the eyes safe and
            protected from potential harm or damage. Safety eyewear encompasses
            a range of eye protection, including safety glasses, safety goggles,
            face shields and face masks. Safety eyewear is made in a range of
            materials and can have lenses with different coloured tints,
            depending on what the eye needs protecting from. Polarised lenses
            for example reduce sun, snow and water glare. Blue lenses in safety
            eyewear help to protect the eyes from prolonged exposure to yellow
            light.
            <br /><br />
            Safety eyewear is very important when working a job or undertaking
            an activity in which potential hazardous material could potentially
            come into contact with the eye, or when the eye is at risk of being
            injured or damaged. According to the Better Health Channel, things
            that cause damage to the eye include chemicals, dust, debris,
            compressed air, oils, bright lights or UV lights. If you do not wear
            safety eyewear whilst engaging in these situations, you could risk
            causing damage to the eye, putting your vision at risk. Potential
            eye injuries include scratches, burns and foreign bodies in the eye.
            <br /><br />
            By wearing safety eyewear when engaging in high risk activities, you
            help protect your eyes and maintain good eye health.

          <h2>7. Keep the Germs Away</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Keeping the germs away is a good tip when considering how to
            maintain the health of your eyes and eyesight. Keeping the germs
            away refers to maintaining good eye hygiene. Good eye hygiene is
            important as it helps to prevent the eyes from getting infections
            such as a sty, or inflammation, such as conjunctivitis. There are
            several ways to keep the germs away from your eyes including not
            touching the eyes with dirty hands, not using old makeup, and
            regularly cleaning glasses. The best ways to keep good eye hygiene
            are listed below.

              Do not touch your eyes with your hands: Keeping the hands away
              from the eyes is a good way to ensure good eye health. If there is
              something in the eye that can not be removed without touching your
              eyeball, it is best to consult an optometrist or health care
              professional.

            <li>
              Clean your eyes with a soft material like cotton wool: If the eyes
              need cleaning for any reason, such as eye discharge, Healthdirect
              recommends doing so with a material like a cotton wool pad, soaked
              in clean water. You should not use the same pad for both eyes as
              this could bring germs from one eye into the other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t use old makeup and clean makeup brushes: Old makeup harbours
              germs and bacteria that pose a potential infection risk to the
              eye. It is important to check the best by date on the packages of
              makeup and not use them past this. Another good tip is to wash
              makeup brushes regularly as these collect bacteria that could lead
              to an eye infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regularly clean your glasses: Regularly cleaning your frames and
              your lenses is a good way to maintain good eye hygiene as these
              surfaces pick up dirt and other germs that enter the eye. Using a
              lens spray or clean glasses cloth, ensures the glasses are free of
              dirt.
            </li>
          </ol>

            Keeping good eye hygiene is a good way to maintain good eye and
            eyesight health.

          <h2>8. Wear Your Glasses</h2>
          <p>
            Wearing your glasses is a good way to maintain the health of your
            eye and eyesight. Glasses refers to a pair of frames and lenses,
            either prescription or non-prescription, that you wear over your
            eyes. Prescription glasses are given to a patient by an optometrist,
            who will have tested the eyes and determined that the eyes need
            vision correction. Non-prescription glasses refer to sunglasses or
            blue light glasses.
            <br /><br />
            It is important that a person wear their prescription glasses if
            they have been told to do so by an optometrist. If you have a
            condition such as hyperopia, myopia or astigmatism, you may be
            prescribed glasses to correct the vision problem and help the eyes
            see clearer.
            <br /><br />
            Reasons that people do not wear their glasses include that they may
            be easy to forget if you are in a rush somewhere. Patients may also
            not wear glasses if they are going through a tough adjustment
            period, say going from single vision to multifocal lenses. Patients
            can also feel that their glasses are not right, do not help them, or
            make their vision worse. However, it is important that you wear your
            glasses to protect your eyesight and give your eyes the vision
            assistance they need. If you do not wear your glasses, the eyes have
            to work harder to see, resulting in eye strain and headaches. If a
            patient believes that their glasses are hindering their eyesight
            more than helping, or are giving them symptoms such as headaches,
            this is a possible indication that there is an error with the
            prescription lenses or frame fit. Instead of halting the wearing of
            glasses, patients should go back to their optometrist and get their
            glasses updated or fixed.
            <br /><br />
            It is important to wear your prescribed glasses to maintain the
            health of your eyes and give your eyesight the help it needs.

          <h2 class="addTopMargin">9. Tell Someone if Your Vision Changes</h2>
          <p>
            Telling someone if your vision changes is one of the most important
            tips in maintaining eye and eyesight health. A vision change is
            described as any changes or alterations to the way you see. Vision
            changes can involve blurry vision, squinting, trouble focusing the
            eye, black spots, floaters or flashes of light.
            <br /><br />
            Some changes to vision may occur gradually, over time. If a patient
            has presbyopia for example, an age-related condition in which the
            eyes struggle to focus on nearby objects, the blurring of vision may
            occur slowly and worsen over time. Other vision changes may occur
            quickly. In this case, it is important to see an optometrist or
            medical attention as soon as possible, as these may have underlying
            health problems.
            <br /><br />
            Vision changes, whether minor and gradual, or ones that happen fast,
            need to be checked by an optometrist to keep the eyes healthy and
            maintain good vision.
          </p>

          <h2 class="addTopMargin">10. Stay Physically Active</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Staying physically active is an important part of maintaining good
            eye health and eyesight. Being physically active or exercising
            refers to regularly engaging in some form of physical activity,
            whether this is walking, running, swimming, lifting weights at the
            gym, boxing, pilates and playing sports. According to the Australian
            Government’s Department of Health and Aged Care, adults ages 18-64
            should have 2.5-5 hours of moderate physical activity a week and
            1.25 to 2.5 hours of vigorous exercise. For adults 65 and above, the
            recommendation is 30 minutes of moderate activity most days.
            <br /><br />
            Staying physically active is great for overall health as well as
            good for eye health. Exercising is hugely beneficial to your body
            and your eyes as it reduces the risk of health conditions such as
            cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and lower cholesterol,
            which may affect the eyes. Physical activity also helps to manage
            weight and strengthen the muscles. Those who do not exercise
            regularly put themselves at higher risk of developing these health
            issues and eye problems such as age-related macular degeneration.
            <br /><br />
            Staying regularly physically active is a big help in maintaining
            overall health, which in turn benefits eye health and eyesight.

          <h2>Why is it Important to Keep Your Eyesight Healthy?</h2>
          <p>
            It is important to keep your eyesight healthy so that your eyes and
            vision can function as effectively as possible. Your eyes are made
            up of several structures that all work together to help you see.
            When light enters the eye, it hits the retina, a structure at the
            back of your eye. Cells called photoreceptors then turn the light
            into electrical signals that get sent to the brain via the optic
            nerve. It is important to keep your eyes healthy so that these
            processes can work well, ensuring good vision.
            <br /><br />
            It is also important to keep your eyesight healthy as your eyes are
            one of your most important organs. The eyes allow you to see the
            world around you, helping you to interact with other people and
            complete daily tasks. If your eyesight is not kept healthy, this may
            interfere with daily life. Those who have eye diseases, such as
            age-related macular degeneration (AMD) for example, may find certain
            daily tasks difficult, which can affect their quality of life.
          </p>

          <h3>What are the Benefits of Healthy Eyesight?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The benefits of having healthy eyesight include a higher quality of
            life and better overall health. Though there are many happy and
            healthy people who live good and fulfilled lives with limited or no
            vision, for many people, having healthy eyesight is important and
            something they would struggle without. Many people rely on good
            vision for their lifestyle and jobs. The benefits of having healthy
            eyes and good sight are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Higher quality of life:</b> Having poor vision can affect a
              person’s quality of life. Not being able to see makes conducting
              daily activities such as driving difficult. Those who have
              conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in
              which the central vision begins to blur, may cause depression and
              anxiety in some patients. Having healthy eyes can reduce the risk
              of these eye diseases and help you maintain a higher quality of
              life for longer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Better health:</b> Having healthy eyes and eyesight can be an
              indication of good overall health. If people have conditions such
              as diabetes or cardiovascular issues, this can affect the
              structures of the eye. By keeping a healthy lifestyle and lowering
              the risk of these conditions, you will have better overall health
              and better eye health.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What is the Perfect Vision for a Healthy Eyesight?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            There is no such thing as perfect vision for healthy eyesight.
            Perfect vision means something different to each individual,
            depending on their lifestyle and individual needs. However, there
            are several criteria that one may use to measure whether they have
            good vision, listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Acuity:</b> Visual acuity refers to the sharpness and
              clarity of your vision. Visual acuity is measured by an
              optometrist using an eye chart, such as a Snellen Chart. Visual
              acuity is measured as a fraction, with 20/20 vision widely
              regarded as the baseline or average vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Depth perception:</b> If a person has good depth perception,
              they may consider themselves to have good vision. Depth perception
              is your eye’s ability to judge how far one object is away in
              relation to another object. It also refers to how the eye judges
              the distance of an object from the viewer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Peripheral vision:</b> If a person has good peripheral vision,
              they may consider themselves to have good eyesight. Peripheral
              vision refers to the part of your eyesight outside the central
              visual field, in simple terms the sides of your vision,
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Colour perception:</b> Colour perception refers to the eyes
              ability to perceive different wavelengths of light or colour. If
              you have good colour perception, you may consider this an
              indication of good eyesight.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            The good foods that are beneficial to eye health and vision include
            fish, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, carrots, yellow and orange fruits,
            and eggs. Good foods are defined as those that are nutrient rich and
            low in refined sugar and fats. Good food is hugely beneficial as
            what a person eats affects their overall health, including the
            health of the eyes. If overall health and eye health are maintained,
            this helps the eyes to function well. Eating well can also help
            reduce the risk of eye diseases such as age-related macular
            degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. The good foods that are beneficial
            to eye health and vision are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Fish:</b> Fish, such as salmon and tuna, are good for keeping
              eyes healthy as they are high in omega-3 fatty acids. These
              nutrients help improve eye health by protecting the retina and
              preventing eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration
              (AMD). Omega-3 may reduce dry eye symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Nuts and Seeds:</b> Nuts and seeds are good for eye health as
              they are high in vitamin E, which may protect the eye and prevent
              diseases such as cataracts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Leafy Greens:</b> Dark, leafy greens such as kale, spinach and
              collards, are good for eye health as they are high in vitamins C
              and E as well as the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. These
              minerals can help to prevent eye diseases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Carrots:</b> Carrots are good for helping to improve eye health
              as they are a source of vitamin A and beta carotene, both of which
              protect the eye against infections and eye diseases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs, particularly the egg yolk, are a good food for
              maintaining eye health as they have a range of vitamins from zinc
              and vitamin A to lutein and zeaxanthin. Together these nutrients
              help protect the cornea part of the eye, and help to reduce the
              risk of cataracts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Yellow and orange fruits:</b> Yellow and orange fruits such as
              oranges and grapefruits help with eye health as they provide
              vitamin C and E, which help protect the blood vessels in the eye.
              Vitamin C and E also helps to prevent eye damage, and reduce the
              risk of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration
              (AMD).

            Your eyesight can not be improved naturally if you have a vision

            have a structural cause and require optometry treatment. The way
            that eyesight is improved or vision issues corrected, involves
            treatment such as corrective glasses or a procedure such as laser
            eye surgery. You may be able to help keep eyes healthy by eating
            well, exercising, wearing sunglasses and using protective eyewear,
            however, these things will not improve or fix vision issues that
            have a structural cause.

            It is not recommended that you check your eyesight at home as the
            results of home eye tests often provide inaccurate and misleading
            results. If you need an eye test, book an appointment with an Oscar

          <h3>When Should I See an Eye Doctor?</h3>
          <p>
            When you should see an eye doctor depends upon which eye doctor you
            are seeing. There are three main types of eye care professionals;
            optometrists, optical dispensers and ophthalmologists.
            <br /><br />
            Your optometrist is your first point of contact for eye care and is
            the eye care professional conducting your annual eye test. If you
            are under 65, it is recommended that you see an optometrist every
            two years. If you are above 65, then annual eye tests are
            recommended.
            <br /><br />
            An optical dispenser dispenses glasses and fits your eyewear. You
            will usually see them after a consultation with your optometrist, as
            they use the prescription from the optometrist to find the lenses
            and frames that are right for you.
            <br /><br />
            If you need to see an ophthalmologist, this is usually at the
            discretion of your optometrist or doctor, as ophthalmologists are
            eye care specialists, treating more serious vision problems beyond
            the expertise of an optometrist, such as advanced glaucoma.
