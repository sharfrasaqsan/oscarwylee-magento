          <h1>Do Blue Light Glasses Work?</h1>
          <p>
            Do blue light glasses work is one of the most pressing questions
            surrounding this trending eyewear piece. The definition of blue
            light glasses is a pair of glasses that aim to block blue light from
            entering the eye. The main area of debate regarding blue light
            glasses revolves around their effectiveness and whether or not they
            help protect the eyes from blue light, prevent disruption to
            sleeping patterns and relieve digital eye strain. Blue light is a
            type of light that is produced naturally from the sun, which is
            where people get most of their exposure. It is also emitted from
            digital devices.
            <br /><br />
            It is believed that blue light glasses can be effective in reducing
            the amount of blue light entering the eye. It has been reported by
            customers that blue light glasses make people more comfortable when
            working with digital devices. Scientific evidence is yet to
            definitively conclude whether or not blue light is actually harmful,
            however, it is theorised by some healthcare professionals to be
            potentially damaging to the eyes. It may also disrupt sleeping
            patterns and contribute to eye fatigue. <br /><br />
            Here at Oscar Wylee, our blue light protection comes in the form of
            a filter. This filter is applied to the lenses of any of our optical
            glasses, prescription or non-prescription. You can wear your blue
            light glasses whilst on work at the computer, at home playing video
            games, or any other situation in which you are looking at a digital
            screen for a long time.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, we believe that choosing blue light glasses is at
            the discretion of the customer. We make sure our customers are well
            informed about the potential benefits and evidence surrounding blue
            light filters so they make an informed choice. Blue light glasses do
            not harm the eye and the added UV protection that our blue light
            filter has, can be beneficial in protecting the eye from UV rays.

              <h2>What are the Blue Light Glasses Benefits?</h2>

              <p class="minusPadding">
                The benefits of blue light glasses are that they may protect the
                eye, relieve digital eye strain and potentially improve sleep.
                There are several main areas of concern when it comes to blue
                light; the potential of this light to damage the eye, the
                potential sleep disruption caused by this light and its
                contribution to visual fatigue and digital eye strain. Blue
                light glasses aim to try and offset these issues by blocking
                blue light from entering the eye. The potential benefits of blue
                light glasses are listed below.

                <b>Protect the eye:</b> Blue light glasses potentially reduce
                the amount of blue light entering the eye, in turn protecting
                it.

                <b>Relieve digital eye strain and fatigue:</b> Blue light
                glasses may help relieve the digital eye strain and the fatigue,
                associated with extended periods of screen time. Some customers
                report that they feel more comfortable wearing blue light
                glasses when looking at digital screens for an extended period
                of time.

              <li>
                <b>Improve sleep:</b> Blue light glasses may help improve sleep
                by blocking the amount of blue light the eyes take in. It has
                been theorised that prolonged exposure to blue light may disrupt
                the sleep cycle. According to a study published in The
                Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS),
                conducted by Chang, Aeschbach, Duffy and Czeisler, people
                exposed to blue light before bed released smaller amounts of
                melatonin, the chemical that helps with sleep. Wearing blue
                light glasses may help to reduce this sleep disruption.

          <h3>Should I Get Blue Light Glasses?</h3>
          <p>
            The decision to get blue light glasses, or our Oscar Wylee blue
            light filter, is a personal choice. However, it is worth noting that
            blue light glasses do not negatively impact the eyes. So if you are
            interested in seeing if the filter works for you and your lifestyle,
            there is little harm in trying them out.
          </p>

          <h3>Are Blue Light Glasses Effective?</h3>
          <p>
            The effectiveness of blue light glasses is still under investigation
            and research. Studies on short term effectiveness have shown that
            blue light glasses may reduce the amount of blue light entering the
            eye, however the long term effects are still unclear.
            <br /><br />
            A 2017 study conducted by Tsz Wing Leung, Roger Wing-hong Li,
            Chea-su Kee, assessed the effectiveness of several types of blue
            light filtering lenses. Their research showed that these glasses
            were effective in reducing blue light transmission to a
            degree.According to the researchers X, Y, Z and their paper “Blue
            Light Filteirng……” in 2017, The study stated that the lenses
            “theoretically reduced the calculated phototoxicity by 10.6% to
            23.6%” (Leung et al., 2017) with phototoxicity referring to
            irritation caused by UV or blue light.
            <br /><br />
            A 2021 psychology based study by Guarana, Barnes, and Ong, theorised
            that blue light filters may help to improve sleep quality and
            quantity, which in turn, can help to boost overall performance in
            workplace settings. The experiment posited that blue light filtering
            improved “physiological (sleep), attitudinal (work engagement), and
            behavioral (task performance, organisational citizenship behaviour,
            and counterproductive work behavior) outcomes” (Barnes et al.,
            2021).

              <h2>What Affects the Efficiency of Blue Light Glasses?</h2>
              <p>
                There is no specific criteria that may affect the efficiency of
                blue light glasses. However, if you have a blue light filter
                added to your optical prescription, any problems with your
                prescription will change how effective your glasses are. If you
                have a blue light filter applied to a non-prescription lens,
                problems with the frame fit will affect how well your blue light
                glasses work. If you have any problems with your glasses, be
                sure to come in and see the team at Oscar Wylee for any
                adjustments.

            What are the Most Important Criteria for Blue Light Blocking
            Glasses?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most important criteria for blue light blocking glasses revolves
            around how well your glasses fit, how comfortable they are, whether
            they match your personal style and whether or not your prescription
            is correct. At Oscar Wylee, our blue light filter is applied to the
            lenses of any of our prescription or non-prescription glasses. This
            means that the criteria that your blue light glasses need to meet
            are less about the actual filter and more about the glasses
            themselves. The important criteria for blue light blocking glasses
            are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              Frames that fit: Frames that fit your face properly are an
              important criteria when picking blue light glasses. Ill fitting
              frames may fall off the face or distort your vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Frames that match your personal style: Finding frames that reflect
              your personality and personal style are an important criteria to
              meet when buying blue light glasses
            </li>
            <li>
              Lenses are the right prescription: It is important when buying
              glasses that you make sure your prescription is correct. If your
              prescription is too strong or too weak, you may struggle with
              distorted vision, eye strain or headaches. If you feel that your
              prescription is not right, be sure to check with your optometrist.
              You can get our Oscar Wylee blue light filter applied to
              non-prescription lenses.

          <h2>Who Founded Blue Light Blocking Glasses?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The first blue light blocking glasses were founded in the 1980s by
            Joseph Sugarman, an American businessman. Sugarman was inspired by a
            pair of sunglasses made for NASA which attempted to reduce the UV
            light in space. Sugarman took this idea and released a line of
            sunglasses called BluBlockers, which aimed to block UV rays and blue
            light from the sun.
            <br /><br />
            The current form of blue light glasses, that aim to block out blue
            light emitted from digital devices, first came to fruition back in
            the 90s. According to The Nobel Prize Organisation, man-made blue
            light was first created in the 90s by three scientists Isamu
            Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura. However, it would take
            significant additional work and experimenting before efficient blue
            light LED lights would become popularised, with the three scientists
            winning the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize in Physics for their
            groundbreaking work.
            <br /><br />
            When blue light started to be used in digital devices, some health
            care experts expressed concerns about the effects of blue light
            exposure. As a result, blue light glasses that used a similar
            concept to Sugarman’s BluBlockers, began to become popularised, as
            did built in blue light filters on digital devices.

            What are the Effects of Blue Light on the Human Eye?
          </h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The effects of blue light on human eyes are increased awareness, eye
            fatigue and retinal damage. The effects of blue light on the human
            eyes are listed below.
          </p>

          <h3 class="TopMargin">Are Blue Light Glasses Worth it?</h3>
          <p>
            Whether blue light glasses are worth it is up to the individual and
            their eye care needs. If you have a lifestyle in which you are
            engaging in screen time for extended periods of time, it may be
            worth trying out these glasses. Blue light glasses do not damage the
            eyes, and our Oscar Wylee blue light filters have a high level of UV
            protection, so there is no harm in giving them a go.

              <p class="minusPadding">
                Blue light has not yet been scientifically proven to be harmful
                to eyes, however, it may contribute to digital eye strain, eye
                fatigue and a disrupted sleep schedule. Blue light is a type of
                light found in the electromagnetic energy, or light, spectrum.
                It naturally occurs in the sun, where we receive most of our
                blue light exposure. Man-made blue light is found in digital
                screens and LED light bulbs.
                <br /><br />
                Blue light has a shorter wavelength than most other light,
                meaning it passes straight through the eye to the back of the
                retina. Some have theorised that this could potentially be
                harmful to the eye’s retinal cells and contribute to issues like
                macular degeneration. However, given that artificial blue light
                from screens is a relatively new technology, there are no long
                term studies that can prove this.

          <p>
            There is no definitive evidence to say that varying levels of blue
            light impacts adults or children differently.
            <br /><br />
            It has been theorised that extended periods of time on digital
            devices may contribute to the progression of myopia in children.
            Although this is likely due to the nature of the close or near work
            than the blue light. It is recommended that school aged children be
            limited to no more than two hours of screen time or near work a day.

            There is no sure way to understand whether blue light glasses work,
            as each person will have their own experience with these glasses.
            Some customers report that wearing blue light glasses have made
            looking at digital screens for an extended period of time more
            comfortable, whilst others do not report any changes. It is up to
