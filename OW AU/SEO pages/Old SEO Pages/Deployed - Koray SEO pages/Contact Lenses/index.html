          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Soft Contact Lenses:</span>
            Soft contact lenses are types of contacts made from soft materials
            such as silicone hydrogels or hydrogel and are softer and more
            flexible, easier to take in and out of the eye. Soft contact lenses,
            however, may absorb pollutants easier than hard contact lenses,
            according to the Cleveland Clinic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Hard Contact Lenses:</span>
            Hard contact lenses also known as gas permeable (GP) or rigid gas
            permeable (RGP) contact lenses are made from oxygen-permeable
            silicone polymers, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Hard contact
            lenses are stiffer and more durable than soft contact lenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Extended Wear Contact Lenses:</span>
            Extended wear contact lenses are contact lenses designed to be worn
            during the day and at night, for an extended period of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Daily Contact Lenses:</span>
            Daily contact lenses are contact lenses worn during the day only.
            Daily contact lenses can be single-use, designed to be worn once
            during the day only, then disposed of. Daily contact lenses may also
            be stored and used again, depending on what your eye care provider
            has advised.

        <ul class="ordered-list">
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Presbyopia:</span>
            Presbyopia is an age-related eye condition in which the lens of the
            eye loses elasticity and becomes hard, leading to issues with near
            vision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Hyperopia:</span>
            Hyperopia or farsightedness is a refractive error in which light
            lands behind the retina instead of on the retina leading to issues
            with near vision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Myopia:</span>
            Myopia or nearsightedness is a refractive error in which light hits
            before the retina not on the retina as it should, resulting in
            issues with far vision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Astigmatism:</span>
            Astigmatism is a type of refractive error in which the cornea or
            lens is too curved, leading to light not hitting the retina properly
            and blurry near and distance vision.

            It is important that a person washes their hands before touching
            contact lenses as unclean hands can spread germs and bacteria onto
            the lens, which can then transfer into the eye.

            It is important to follow the instructions that your healthcare

            length of time contacts can be used and the replacement time for

            Storing contact lenses correctly, including using their case and any

            sanitary and in good condition.

            It is not recommended to use contact lenses when swimming as the

            It is important that a person only wears the contact lenses that

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Vision correction:</span>
          Contact lenses can correct a variety of vision problems caused by
          refractive errors, such as farsightedness, nearsightedness, presbyopia
          and astigmatism. For people who have issues with both near and far
          vision, multifocal contact lenses are also available.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Wide range of vision:</span>
          As contact lenses are placed on the eye rather than over the face like
          glasses, they offer a wider range of vision with less obstruction.
          Contact lenses also move with your eyes so there is a natural field of
          view.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Convenient:</span>
          Contact lenses are very convenient as you don’t have to worry about
          storing them or scratching the lenses. They are also very convenient
          when in the sun as you do not have to switch between non-prescription
          and prescription sunglasses, you can simply bring a pair of
          non-prescription sunglasses.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Safe for sports:</span>
          Playing sports can be difficult and potentially dangerous while
          wearing glasses, which is why contact lenses are a great option as
          they do not get in the way and are not at risk of falling off your
          face. Contact lenses also don’t fog up and they provide a wider field
          of vision which is beneficial when playing sport.

          Wearing contact lenses can increase a person’s risk of developing an

          include conjunctivitis and keratitis.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">More care required:</span>
          Putting in and taking out contact lenses takes more care and skill
          than simply putting on a pair of glasses. You will also have to clean
          the contacts if they are extended wear and use contact lens solution.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Can take time to adjust:</span>
          For some people, contact lenses can be a big adjustment especially if

            Contact lenses can cause the eyes to become dry, creating a feeling
            of scratchiness and irritation. Contacts may cause dry eyes as they
            partially block oxygen from entering the eye.

          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Eye inflammation:</span>
            Wearing contact lenses may cause eye inflammation, specifically
            inflammation of the cornea. According to the Centres for Disease
            Control and Prevention (CDC), not washing your contact lens supplies
            properly can increase your risk of eye inflammation.

            Contact lenses may cause an allergic reaction as the wearer could be
