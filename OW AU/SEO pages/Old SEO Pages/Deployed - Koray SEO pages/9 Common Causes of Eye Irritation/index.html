      <p class="para-content mobile-para-margin">
        The top 9 common causes of eye irritation include eye allergies, dry
        eye, eye infection, digital eye strain, eye irritants, foreign objects
        in the eyes, contact lenses, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis. Eye
        irritation is defined as a sensation of discomfort in the eye. Eye
        irritation can include itchy and watery eyes, burning eyes, red eyes and
        a gritty feeling in the eye. The treatments for an irritated eye depend
        on the type of eye irritation that is occurring. For dry eyes, for
        example, artificial eye drops may help bring moisture back into the eye
        and reduce irritation. This article will discuss the possible causes,
        treatments and preventions for eye irritation.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Eye Allergies</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Eye allergies, also known as allergic conjunctivitis, are a
          <b>common cause of eye irritation including watery and itching eyes</b
          >. Eye allergies, or allergic conjunctivitis, refers to a condition in
          which the eyes become irritated and inflamed due to exposure to
          allergens or environmental irritants such as animal dander, pollen or
          grass. There are two main types of eye allergies; seasonal allergies
          and perennial allergies. Seasonal allergies occur during a specific
          season, usually spring or summer, and are often caused by the release
          of pollen from plants and grass. According to Allergy and Anaphylaxis
          Australia, perennial allergies last all year round and are often
          caused by dust, mould and animal dander. <br /><br />When the eyes,
          specifically the conjunctiva, the membrane that covers the whites of
          the eyes and inner eyelids, come in contact with an allergen, the body
          releases a chemical called histamine to try and expel the allergen.
          Eye irritation is part of the body’s histamine response to these
          allergens. Eye irritation from allergic conjunctivitis or eye
          allergies can include red eyes, itchy eyes and watery eyes. Additional
          symptoms of eye allergies include swollen eyes and a burning feeling
          in the eyes. Treatment for eye allergies includes antihistamines such
          as oral tablets and eye drops.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">2. Dry Eye</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Dry eye is one of the
          <b
            >top causes of eye irritation, including itching and stinging in the
            eye</b
          >. Dry eyes refer to a condition in which the eyes do not produce
          enough tears to lubricate the surface of the eye, leading to dryness.
          Tears are made up of three layers known collectively as the tear film.
          The tear film is what covers the surface of the eye and includes an
          oily outer layer, watery middle layer and mucous-like inner layer,
          according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. If a person has
          dry eyes, there is a problem with one, or all of these layers, which
          leads to a lack of lubrication and dry eyes. Dry eyes are a common
          cause of eye irritation as the lack of lubrication in the eye can
          cause itchiness, redness and burning or stinging in the eye.
          Additional symptoms of dry eyes can include mucous secretion around
          the eyes and a heavy, tired feeling in the eyes, according to the
          Better Health Channel. Dry eyes may also cause excessive tearing.
          <br /><br />Dry eyes are caused by factors such as ageing and certain
          medications. According to Health Direct, Australia’s virtual public
          health information service, females, people who wear contact lenses
          and those on digital screens for long periods of time are at a higher
          risk of developing dry eye. According to the Better Health Channel,
          dry eyes can not be cured, but specific treatments may be used to help
          improve the symptoms of the condition. The most common treatment for
          dry eye includes eye drops such as artificial tears, that help bring
          lubrication to the eye, as well as eye ointment and eye gels that try
          to achieve the same outcome.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">3. Eye Infections</h3>
        <p class="para-content" style="margin-bottom: 0">
          Eye infections are
          <b
            >a common cause of eye irritation, including itching, swelling and
            watery eyes</b
          >. Eye infections refer to an infection that is caused by a type of
          microorganism. Microorganisms that cause eye infections include
          bacteria, viruses or fungi. Eye infections are a common cause of eye
          irritation as they infect the structures of the eye, leading to
          inflammation and swelling. Keratitis is an infection of the cornea,
          the part of the eye that lets light in, for example. Keratitis
          infections include eye herpes or herpes simplex keratitis. Eye herpes
          causes eye irritation due to the virus, most commonly HSV-1, infecting
          the cornea, leading to inflammation, eye redness, itchy eyes, watery
          eyes or a gritty feeling in the eye. Other symptoms of eye infections
          will depend on the type of eye infection a person has but may include
          red eyes, swollen eyes and mild pain in the eye. <br /><br />Types of
          eye infections include conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, uveitis,
          cellulitis, eye herpes, blepharitis, styes and keratitis. The
          treatment for an eye infection will depend on which type a person has.
          Eye infections caused by bacteria, such as bacterial conjunctivitis,
          may be treated with antibiotics. Viral infections such as eye herpes
          may be treated with oral or topical antiviral medications. Treatment
          for eye infections can also include methods that help reduce eye
          irritation, such as artificial tears to help lubricate dry eyes.

              Digital eye strain, sometimes known as computer vision syndrome,
              <b>may cause eye irritation such as dry, itchy or sore eyes</b>.
              Digital eye strain refers to a feeling of strain, tiredness or
              soreness in the eyes, after having focused on a digital screen for
              an extended period of time. A digital screen can include
              computers, laptops, tablets or mobile phones. Digital eye strain
              can also lead to eye irritation such as itchy eyes, dry eyes, a
              burning feeling in the eyes, as well as eye soreness. Other
              symptoms of digital eye strain include headaches and blurry

          According to Cedars-Sinai, a California healthcare organisation,
          digital eye strain can be caused by a variety of factors when using
          digital devices, including a lack of blinking, poor posture, screen
          glare and uncorrected vision issues. Blue light, the type of
          artificial light used in digital screens, has also been theorised to
          have negative effects on the eyes, however, not all research on this
          is conclusive. Treatment for digital eye strain includes prescription
          glasses for close work if necessary and computer glasses, which may
          help to relieve some eye strain when looking at screens. Additional
          methods to reduce digital eye strain include taking frequent breaks
          from looking at a digital screen. The Cleveland Clinic suggests the
          20-20-20 rule, in which a person takes a 20-second break every 20
          minutes to look at an object 20 feet away, or 6 metres, to lessen the
          strain on the eye. Setting your desk and computer up in a more
          ergonomic way, including increasing the font size on the screen and
          making sure the screen is in front of your face, an arm’s length away
          may also help to reduce eye strain, according to Queensland Health.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">5. Eye Irritants</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Eye irritants are a
          <b
            >common cause of irritation in the eye, including itchiness, watery
            eyes and a burning sensation in the eye</b
          >. Eye irritants describe a substance or object that causes eye
          irritation. According to The Cleveland Clinic, eye irritants include
          chlorinated pool water, dry weather, wind, cigarette smoke and smog.
          The medical condition eczema may also irritate the eyes and their
          surrounding areas. Some eye irritants may cause an allergic reaction
          in certain people, called allergic conjunctivitis, whereas others may
          find that these factors simply irritate the eye for a short period of
          time. <br /><br />The symptoms that eye irritants cause in the eye
          will be dependent upon the type of irritants, for instance, those who
          have been exposed to chlorinated pool water may find that their eyes
          are irritated, with symptoms possibly including stinging in the eye
          and red eyes. The treatment for any symptoms caused by eye irritants
          is dependent upon what that irritant is. The treatment for someone who
          has eye irritation as the result of dry weather may be artificial
          tears, to bring some moisture back into the eye.

          <b
            >A foreign object in the eye can cause eye irritation, but can also
            be a serious eye injury. It is important to seek medical attention
            if you have a foreign object in the eyes and have symptoms such as
            pain, bleeding, blurriness or if your vision is affected.</b
          >
          <br /><br />Foreign objects in the eye
          <b
            >may cause eye irritation such as watery eyes, red eyes, itching
            eyes, and a feeling of something in the eye</b
          >. A foreign object in the eyes refers to an object that is in the
          eye, on the surface of the eye, or under the eyelid, that should
          typically not be there. According to the Victorian Government’s Better
          Health Channel, a foreign object in the eye can include dust, a small
          piece of glass or metal, grass clippings or wood chips. Additional
          foreign objects that may possibly enter the eye are sawdust and dirt.
          According to Queensland Health’s Clinical Excellence Division,
          symptoms of foreign bodies in the eye include sharp pain, followed by
          a burning or itching sensation in the eye.
          <b
            >Symptoms of a foreign body in the eye that require medical
            attention include sensitivity to bright light, pain, blurry vision
            or vision changes, and fluid from the eye</b
          >. <br /><br />The causes of foreign objects in the eye depend on what
          object has entered the eyes. According to the Victorian Government’s
          Better Health Channel, there are certain people most at risk of
          getting foreign objects in the eyes such as labourers, who are
          frequently working with materials that may enter the eye like metal
          shavings or wood chips. Treatments for foreign objects in the eye
          should be advised by a medical professional and can include eye drops,
          eye ointments, eye patches and pain medication.

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">7. Contact Lenses</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Contact lenses can be a
          <b
            >cause of eye irritation for those who wear the corrective devices,
            with irritation including dry eyes, itchy eyes and watery eyes</b
          >. Contact lenses are thin lenses that are placed on the surface of
          the eye to help a person see better, using the same corrective method
          that prescription glasses do. Contact lenses may cause eye irritation
          due to a variety of factors such as poorly fitting lenses, old contact
          lenses or poor contact lens hygiene. Eye irritation caused by poor
          contact lens usage includes itching, burning eyes, watery eyes, dry
          eyes and a sensation that something is in the eye. <br /><br />Contact
          lenses can also cause a type of condition called contact lens-induced
          papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC) in which the lining of the upper
          eyelid becomes inflamed. According to the paper
          <i
            >General and local contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis
            (CLPC)</i
          >
          by Skotnitsky C, Sankaridurg PR, Sweeney DF, Holden BA, the exact
          cause of CLPC has not been concluded, but it is theorised that
          long-term wear of reusable contact lenses and an immunological
          response to tear film fat deposits on the lens may cause the
          condition. Contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC) may
          cause eye irritation such as itchy eyes and a sensation that something
          is in the eyes and eye discharge. Contact lens wear increases the
          chance of infectious keratitis, an infection of the cornea part of the
          eye. This can be due to the bacteria that may collect on the lenses if
          they are not taken care of appropriately. <br /><br />Treatment for
          eye irritation from contact lenses is dependent upon what exactly has
          caused the irritation and what the symptoms are. A person can prevent
          eye irritation from contact lenses by practising good hygiene when
          handling contact lenses. An optometrist may also advise a change in
          how frequently a person is wearing lenses and what material the lenses
          are.<br /><br /><b

          conjunctivitis each with a different cause. Bacterial conjunctivitis
          is caused by bacteria. Viral conjunctivitis is caused by viruses.
          Allergic conjunctivitis is caused by a reaction to certain irritants
          or allergens such as pollen, dust or animal dander. The treatment for
          conjunctivitis depends on the type a person has. Treatment for
          allergic conjunctivitis may be antihistamines, to reduce inflammation
          and the reaction from exposure to allergens. Treatment for bacterial
          conjunctivitis includes antibiotics and treatment for viral
          conjunctivitis revolves around methods to reduce irritation symptoms,
          such as cold compresses and artificial tears.

          Blepharitis is an eye condition that can
          <b

          bacteria that gathers in the eyelashes or glands of the eyelid,
          according to Health Direct, Australia’s virtual public health
          information service. The inflammation that blepharitis causes around
          the eye can lead to eye irritation such as watery eyes, itchy eyes,
          dry eyes, stinging in the eyes, and burning in the eyes. Other
          symptoms of blepharitis include crusty eyelashes, eye redness and mild
          sensitivity to light. <br /><br />Blepharitis is generally caused by
          bacteria that gather around the eye, in the eyelashes and eyelid
          glands, but can also be caused by fungal or viral infections,
          dandruff, eye drops, makeup use, blocked oil glands and dermatitis,
          according to Health Direct. Treatment for blepharitis includes
          maintaining good eye hygiene such as cleaning the eyelids. You can
          also use a cool compress to reduce swelling. A healthcare professional
          may recommend eye drops such as steroid eye drops to reduce swelling

        be able to treat irritated eyes at home if symptoms are mild and you
        have consulted a healthcare professional first. <br /><br />At-home
        treatments for irritated eyes can include resting the eyes, applying
        cool compresses to the eye, over-the-counter eye drops or ointments,
        washing the eyelids lightly, and calling an eye doctor or healthcare
