      Nystagmus: Definition, Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment
    </h1>
    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content mobile-para-margin">
        The nystagmus definition is a condition that affects vision, causing the
        eyes to involuntarily and rapidly move in up and down (vertical
        nystagmus), circular, or side-to-side (horizontal nystagmus) motions.
        These motions can result in poor vision as both eyes are not able to
        hold a stable focus on objects. The different types of Nystagmus are
        congenital nystagmus and acquired nystagmus. Congenital nystagmus can
        occur in babies, presenting symptoms between the age of six weeks and
        three months. Congenital nystagmus is when you are born with this vision
        condition and may have inherited it from your parents. Acquired
        nystagmus may have many different causes, including underlying medical
        conditions or drug and alcohol consumption and can develop at a later
        stage in life. The causes of nystagmus may include albinism, high-grade
        refractive error, congenital cataracts, conditions in the inner ear,
        certain medications, multiple sclerosis and diseases related to the
        central nervous system. This condition can include symptoms of
        involuntary eye movement that may include eyes shaking side to side,
        blurry vision, dizziness and difficulty balancing, sensitivity to light,
        and vision problems during the night. According to the American
        Optometric Association, nystagmus may be diagnosed by an ophthalmologist
        through a comprehensive eye test and can also involve reviewing the
        patient’s medical history, visual acuity, eye-focusing ability and a
        refraction test. Treatment for nystagmus may involve prescription
        glasses or contact lenses, although they are not able to fix nystagmus,
        they may be able to aid your vision. Using other resources such as
        magnifying devices, more lighting and large font text may also provide
        some help.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What is Nystagmus?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        The answer to what is nystagmus is it is a condition that causes rapid
        and uncontrollable movement in the eyes. According to the American
        Academy of Ophthalmology, nystagmus can cause the eyes to move side to
        side, in a circular motion or up and down and can occur in a fast or
        slow nature. The nystagmus definition also includes the two main types
        of this condition which are congenital nystagmus and acquired nystagmus.
        Congenital nystagmus is when you are born with this condition. Babies
        with congenital nystagmus may start to present symptoms between the ages
        of six weeks and three months old. Acquired nystagmus is the opposite,
        wherein, it is when the condition occurs later in life, as an adult.
        According to John Hopkins Medicine, nystagmus can also be categorised as
        pendular nystagmus and jerk nystagmus. Pendular nystagmus is when the
        eyes swing in a back-and-forth motion and jerk nystagmus can be defined
        as the slow drift in one direction and then a quick jerk back the other
        way.

        <p class="para-content">
          Nystagmus may also be known as dancing eyes as well as congenital
          nystagmus and acquired nystagmus. Other terms such as horizontal
          nystagmus, vertical nystagmus, pendular and jerk nystagmus can also be
          used referring to the different motions that nystagmus may move in.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">Is Nystagmus a Brain Issue?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Yes, nystagmus can be a brain issue. When nystagmus develops, it may
          be that certain areas of the brain that are responsible for eye
          movements are not functioning properly, according to the Cleveland
          Clinic. However, it can also be an issue relating to the inner ear’s
          balance. Brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis can result in
          pendular nystagmus. Jerk nystagmus may typically be a consequence of
          diseases affecting the vestibular organ, located in the inner ear
          according to John Hopkins Medicine.

        <p class="para-content">
          A head injury may cause a number of problems including nystagmus
          depending on the region of the injury. Injuries to the back of the
          head may result in nystagmus as the occipital lobe which is
          responsible for eye movement and eyesight is located in that region. A
          head injury is a broad term to describe a variety of injuries to the
          brain, skull, scalp or blood vessels and tissue in the brain. A head
          injury can range from mild to severe and may call for urgent medical
          attention if other symptoms occur. Symptoms that may indicate a more
          severe head injury can include bleeding, unconsciousness, feeling
          dazed or confused and nausea or vomiting according to Health Direct.

        <p class="para-content">
          Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an ongoing autoimmune disease that affects
          the central nervous system. Multiple sclerosis may result in nystagmus
          as it can cause nerve damage to areas of the brain that correlate with
          vision, muscle movements and balance according to the Multiple
          Sclerosis Trust. These areas are known as the brainstem and
          cerebellum. Nystagmus may also be triggered by multiple sclerosis due
          to potential damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve helps the
          brain to interpret images by transmitting messages from the eyes to
          the brain.

        <p class="para-content">
          A stroke may trigger nystagmus as strokes can occur when the brain's
          blood supply is impeded or when a blood vessel has ruptured in the
          brain. Nystagmus arising from a stroke can depend on which area of the
          brain it occurred in according to the American Stroke Association.
          Damage to the occipital lobe is harmful to the brain’s function of
          processing visual information as it is the primary vision centre in
          the brain. Damage to the brain stem risks the ability to control eye
          movements, see and comprehend objects as well as feelings related to
          stability and balance.

          Meniere’s illness is defined as a disorder in the inner ear that can
          cause hearing and balance problems. Nystagmus may be brought on by
          Meniere’s illness as it can affect the vestibular system in the inner
          ear. Problems that occur in the inner ear can cause issues such as
          dizziness or vertigo according to John Hopkins Medicine. Symptoms of
          Meniere’s illness can include vertigo, loss of hearing, ear ringing
          and ear pressure according to the Mayo Clinic.

          The heavy consumption of alcohol as well as the use of drugs pose many
          health issues including nystagmus due to its potential impact on
          certain parts of the brain. Nystagmus along with other eye problems
          can be triggered by severe alcohol intoxication as it can cause harm
          to the cerebellum. The Cerebellum is an intricate structure in the
          brain that interrelates to the brain stem, cerebral cortex and basal
          ganglia. Hindering cerebellar function may result in gaze instability
          along with gaze-evoked nystagmus according to the National Institutes
          of Health. Gaze-evoked nystagmus is characterised as a type of
          nystagmus that is brought on when the eyes are kept in an eccentric
          position according to Arvo Journals. Nystagmus may also be a symptom
          of intoxication from a mix of drugs according to the American
          Addiction Centres.

          of certain medications that may lead to these harmful ocular effects
          are systemic medications that may include antihistamines, depressants
          for the central nervous system, barbiturates, and elevated blood
          ethanol concentrations. Systemic medications are substances that are

        <p class="para-content">
          Abnormalities of the retina or optic nerve may present as factors that
          contribute to nystagmus. Optic nerve hypoplasia is a disorder that can
          develop at birth and is defined as the underdevelopment of the optic
          nerves. It is noted that the majority of patients with optic nerve
          hypoplasia experience nystagmus according to the National Organisation
          of Rare Disorders. Damage to the optic nerve can hinder its function
          of sending messages from the retina to the brain, which may impede
          interpreting visual information. Retinal disorders that can lead to
          visual loss may commonly result in nystagmus due to the inability of
          maintaining gaze on an object or known as visual fixation.

        <p class="para-content">
          Cataracts in babies or also referred to as congenital cataracts, may
          be accompanied by nystagmus due to two potential reasons.
          Manifest-latent nystagmus may occur as a result of cataracts in babies
          and children due to deterioration of early binocular vision
          development. Binocular vision is defined as using information from
          both eyes. The second possible reason is due to an ongoing state of
          poor vision in one eye. The cause of nystagmus in relation to
          congenital cataracts may be a consequence of early loss of binocular
          vision according to Jay Self and Ian Christopher Lloyd in their book
          Congenital Cataract.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">10. Albinism</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Albinism may lead to nystagmus due to its impact of reduced melanin
          production which can significantly affect the development of the
          visual system and eye. Albinism can result in different visual
          problems such as nystagmus as well as reduced acuity, the translucency
          of the iris and foveal hypoplasia according to the National Library of
          Medicine. Albinism is defined as a genetic condition that causes
          abnormal production of pigmentation in the skin known as melanin.
          According to the National Organisation of Rare Disorders, the fovea’s
          lack of development (foveal hypoplasia) can lead to unusual
          connections in the nerves from the retina to the brain. This hinders
          the eyes from tracking and causes poor visual acuity and nystagmus.

      <p class="para-content">
        The symptoms of nystagmus are sensitivity to light, excessive eye
        movement, balance issues, issues with seeing at night, dizziness and
        unstable or hazy eyesight. The symptoms of nystagmus and their
        definitions are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Sensitivity to Light:</span>
          Sensitivity to light is a symptom that can occur when your eyes hurt
          or feel irritated when exposed to light.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Excessive Eye Movement:</span>
          Excessive eye movement may indicate nystagmus, especially if eye
          movements are uncontrollable and rapid.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Balance Issues:</span>
          Balance issues may occur as a symptom if the nystagmus is related to a
          vestibular system problem.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Issues with Seeing at Night:</span>
          Issues with seeing at night may be a symptom of nystagmus due to
          reduced vision.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Dizziness:</span>
          Dizziness may be a consequence of nystagmus if the condition is caused
          by vestibular system problems in the inner ear.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Unstable or Hazy Eyesight:</span>
          Unstable or hazy eyesight refers to vision that may appear shaky or

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Sensitivity to Light</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Sensitivity to light is defined as a common eye condition that is
          described as pain or discomfort occurring when looking at light. Light
          sensitivity may be a sign of nystagmus but is also a common symptom of
          different eye conditions, so it is important to have your eyes tested
          by an optometrist. In cases of albinism in relation to nystagmus,
          children can experience sensitivity to light according to Gene Vision.
          Using sunglasses when outdoors and avoiding overly bright settings may
          help alleviate sensitivity to light.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">2. Excessive Eye Movement</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Excessive eye movement that is rapid and uncontrollable may be an
          indication of nystagmus. Excessive eye movement in horizontal,
          vertical, circular or a combination of these motion types should be
          examined by an optometrist as clear vision may be affected. The use of
          glasses or contact lenses may help in slowing excessive eye movements
          according to the Cleveland Clinic.

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">3. Balance Issues</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Balance issues are defined as difficulty while walking or feeling out
          of balance, which can occur from problems in the vestibular system in
          the inner ear. Nystagmus in the horizontal or circular form may
          trigger balance issues when caused by diseases in the vestibular organ
          located in the inner ear according to the National Library of
          Medicine.

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">4. Issues with Seeing at Night</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Issues with seeing at night can be described as difficulty seeing
          clearly during nighttime. Nystagmus may cause issues with seeing at
          night as it can cause poor vision due to issues with transmitting
          messages from the eye to the brain. Nystagmus can also lead to
          hindrances in how regions of the brain that control eye movement
          process visual information according to the Royal National Institute
          of Blind People. Prescription of glasses may help improve vision. If
          you are experiencing trouble seeing at night, it is recommended that
          you see an optometrist.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">5. Dizziness</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Dizziness can be described as a feeling of spinning and as if you’re
          losing balance. Dizziness may be a symptom of nystagmus due to
          vestibular disorders. In the case of a vestibular problem causing
          nystagmus, dizziness and vertigo may commonly occur as a consequence
          due to the vestibular system’s role in maintaining balance in the
          body. The vestibular system produces a sense of balance and
          information on the position of our body in relation to gravity
          according to the National Institutes of Health.

        <p class="para-content">
          Unstable or hazy eyesight can be characterized as vision that may
          appear shaky and blurry. Nystagmus may cause this symptom due to
          oscillopsia, which is the sensation of unstable vision and is often
          the result of a nervous system disorder according to All About Vision.
          This disorder can harm areas of the brain that operate eye movements
          and sections of the inner ear that are responsible for balance.

          How do Glasses or Prescription Glasses Help with Nystagmus Symptoms?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Prescription glasses can help with nystagmus symptoms by improving
          vision. Patients with nystagmus may experience blurry, hazy or
          unstable vision therefore using glasses may help to provide clearer
          vision according to the American Optometric Association. It is
          important to note that glasses cannot correct nystagmus but may
          provide some improvement and relief.

            No, there are no glasses for nystagmus specifically. It is
            recommended to speak with an optometrist so they can determine the
            severity of your condition and symptoms. However, glasses with the
            right prescription to suit your visual requirements may still be
            helpful.

            Do Children with Nystagmus Need Glasses?
          </h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            Yes, children with nystagmus may need glasses as their vision may be
            affected. Prescription glasses may be able to sharpen vision that
            may be blurry or hazy as a result of nystagmus. Although glasses
            cannot cure nystagmus, they may help to clear vision and help ensure
            your child has as much optimal vision as possible according to the
            Royal National Institute of Blind People.

      <h2 class="subtitle">How is Nystagmus Diagnosed?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Nystagmus is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam and a test for
        nystagmus may be conducted with a particular focus on eye movement. This
        may involve a visual acuity test, refraction test, and assessing how
        both eyes work together to focus and move according to the American
        Optometric Association. Visual acuity will evaluate how much your vision
        is affected and a refraction test can help decide what lens power may be
        suitable to aid any refractive errors as well as checking whether both
        eyes are able to focus and work together at the same time. Knowing the
        patient’s medical history may also help to identify causes for occurring
        symptoms and whether there may be underlying conditions.

          Optometrists and ophthalmologists can both diagnose nystagmus through
          comprehensive eye testing. According to Vision Australia, you can see
          an optometrist, ophthalmologist or even your GP for vision problems
          including uncontrollable eye movements. It is important to note while
          optometrists can diagnose a range of eye conditions and diseases, they
          are not doctors, there is a difference between optometrists and
          ophthalmologists.

      <h2 class="subtitle">How is Nystagmus Treated?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Nystagmus is typically treated with prescription glasses, although they
        cannot completely correct nystagmus. Having your eyes tested by an
        optometrist can help determine what you may require in your glasses
        prescription. Other resources such as more lighting, magnifying devices
        and larger fonts may also be helpful to increase clear vision for
        patients with nystagmus. According to the Cleveland Clinic, other
        nystagmus treatments can include some medications such as antiseizure,
        and muscle relaxant medications which may be able to reduce symptoms.
