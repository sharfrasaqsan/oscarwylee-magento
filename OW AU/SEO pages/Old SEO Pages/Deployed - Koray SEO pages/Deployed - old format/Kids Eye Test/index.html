          <p>
            Your child’s vision is their greatest source of learning. By getting
            young eyes tested early, you can prevent behavioural disorders,
            enable greater learning, and help your children reach their full
            potential.

          <h2>What is a children’s eye test?</h2>
          <p>
            A children’s eye test is a complete and comprehensive testing of
            your child’s vision skills, as performed by an optometrist. A kid’s
            eye test isn’t very different from an adult test as there will only
            be some minor adjustments to the type of testing done in order to
            make sure your child’s eyes can be fully examined no matter what
            stage of development they are at, while ensuring they will not be
            uncomfortable.

          <h2>How can I check my kid’s eyesight?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, you can perform
            a very basic eye test for your child at home. You will need to print
            one or more eye test charts. You can find vision tests that are safe
            and valid to print and use for your children at
            <a
              href="https://www.sydneyorthoptic.com.au/children-eye-test/eye-test-for-kids/"
              class="linkTo"
              >Sydney Orthoptic</a
            >. Then, you will need something to cover a single eye, like a spoon
            or a paper cup and a stick or something to point with. <br /><br />
            Once you have everything, have your child sit at least 3 metres from
            the chart and say out loud what you are pointing to on the chart as
            you go through it.
            <br /><br />

              exam by a healthcare professional.</strong

          <h2 class="addTopMargin">Statewide Eyesight Preschooler Screening</h2>
          <p>
            The Statewide Eyesight Preschooler Screening, or StEPS program, is a
            NSW health initiative that offers all 4 years old children a free
            eye screening. Other states across Australia offer similar screening
            programs, such as the Primary School Nurse Health Readiness program
            in Queensland or the Melbourne Initial Screening Test in Victoria.
            This screening test is not as extensive as a comprehensive eye test
            and may miss key issues your child has.
            <br /><br />
            As such, it’s advised you also book an appointment with an
            optometrist to ensure your child’s vision is properly checked.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            As at least 80% of a young child’s education is done through visual

            when you suspect there may be issues or at your optometrists
            discretion. <br /><br />
            By testing your children’s vision skills before they first start
            their education, you can have early detection of any vision issues
            and take preventative measures before they could affect your child’s
            education.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            The following are signs that your child might need an eye exam or is
            showing early warning signs that they could have a vision problem.
            These signs are:
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>Low hand eye coordination</li>
            <li>Poor motor skills, repeatedly running into things</li>
            <li>Sore eyes or constant rubbing</li>
            <li>Poor focus and writing</li>
            <li>Unusual eye movements</li>
            <li>Compensatory head posture</li>
            <li>Constant statements of headaches or nausea</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If one or more of these signs, or others, start to affect your
            child’s daily life, consider booking an appointment.

          <h2>What happens during a children's eye test?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Your kids’ eye test will be conducted very similarly to an adult
            test. However, the room and test itself will be made more engaging
            for your child’s convenience and comfort. They will also test your
            child for specific conditions that they may not test you for as an
            adult.
          </p>
          <div class="flexContainer">
            <div class="flexText">
              <ul class="minusPadding">
                <li>
                  First, the test has to be booked in a time that is convenient
                  for your child and when they will be at their calmest and most
                  agreeable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They will likely ask you questions about you and your child’s
                  visual family history before the test begins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In many children’s eye tests, they will use easily
                  recognisable shapes and pictures in place of letters on the
                  LogMAR and Snellen chart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your child will then have their ability to see colour tested,
                  as well as their visual fields and ocular eye movements. Eye
                  pressure testing is another possible test, but it is not one
                  often done for children.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further examination will look for signs of short sightedness,
                  long sightedness, lazy eye, astigmatism or turned eyes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The optometrist will also check the back of the eye for eye
                  health issues
                </li>
                <li>
                  A digital photograph of your child’s eye may also be taken.

          <h2 class="topMargin">When does a child need glasses?</h2>
          <p>
            A child’s vision is constantly developing, this is especially
            important during the schooling years. During this time, a child
            could need glasses in order to help them perform their visual tasks
            as well as further helping the development of their eyes.
            <br /><br />
            Some eye problems may also correct themselves as your child grows,
            such as certain focussing or eye alignment issues. It is recommended
            that an eye test be done every 2-3 years after the initial test for
            this reason.

            have reduced vision, book an appointment with an optometrist to
            perform a thorough examination to determine whether or not this is
