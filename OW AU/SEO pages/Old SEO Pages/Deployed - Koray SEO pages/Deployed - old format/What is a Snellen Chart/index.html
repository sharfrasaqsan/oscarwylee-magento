          <h1>What is a Snellen Chart? A Complete Overview</h1>
          <p>
            If you have ever had a comprehensive eye test with an optometrist,
            itâ€™s likely that you have been asked to read from an eye testing
            chart, with lines of letters that decline in size. This chart is
            called a Snellen Chart.
            <br /><br />
            Keep reading for an overview of the Snellen Chart and how it can be
            used to help test your eyesight.

          <h2>What is a Snellen Chart?</h2>
          <p>
            A Snellen Chart is a type of vision chart that tests the clarity and
            sharpness of your eyesight, also known as
            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/eye-care/eye-test/visual-acuity.html"
              class="linkTo"
              >visual acuity</a
            >. A Snellen Chart may be used during a routine eye test to
            determine how well your eyes see the details of an object at a
            distance of 20 feet, or 6 metres, away. The results from the Snellen
            test can be helpful in deciding if you need any corrective glasses.

          <h2>The history of the Snellen Chart.</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The Snellen Chart was first created in 1862 by Dutch ophthalmologist
            Herman Snellen. Snellen is supposed to have created the chart on
            request of his associate Dr. Franciscus Donders, who used early
            versions of a wall mounted eye chart to identify vision problems.

            What do the lines and letters mean on a Snellen Chart?

          <p class="minusPadding">

              class="linkTo"
              >20/20 vision</a
            >, which is commonly understood to refer to clear vision, or normal
            visual acuity. But did you know that this ratio refers to the
            Snellen Chart? Each line of letters on a Snellen Chart is given a
            ratio like this. It is an indication of how clearly you can see.
            <br /><br />
            The letters on a Snellen Chart are used to help test how well your
            eyes can identify details in objects. You may notice that the
            Snellen Chart does not use all letters of the alphabet. I, J, M, Q,
            W, X, and Y are not often used as they have been shown to be too
            difficult to read at a distance of 6 metres, regardless of how good
            your vision is.

          <h2>Snellen Chart vs LogMAR Chart</h2>

          <div class="flexContainer">
            <div class="flexText">
              <p>
                At Oscar Wylee, we use certain elements of the Snellen Chart
                when testing your vision. However, we also use it in conjunction
                with another chart that tests visual acuity, called a LogMAR
                chart. LogMAR charts may look very similar to Snellen Charts,
                but they are not the same. They use a different measurement for
                scoring visual acuity and are formatted differently.
                <br /><br />
                LogMAR charts will have the same number of letters per line
                regardless of size, and the spacing between letters is usually
                equivalent to the letter size. LogMAR scoring will usually
                involve a decimal. Snellen Charts by comparison will have more
                letters as the sizing decreases. They also have irregular
                spacing between letters and are scored as a ratio.
                <br /><br />
                At Oscar Wylee our eye testing charts, which are digitised, are
                called ETDRS charts. ETDRS charts are a revised, modified
                version of a Snellen Chart. Our ETDRS charts have 5 letters per
                line, in keeping with LogMAR, and use the Bailey Lovie layout,
                which has a proportional spacing between the letters.

          <h2>How is a Snellen Chart used during a visual acuity test?</h2>
          <p>
            A Snellen Chart usually consists of 11 lines of block letters. The
            first row will often be one or two large letters, with each line
            after this consisting of different letters declining in size. When
            using a Snellen Chart, your optometrist will position you 20 feet,
            or 6 metres back from the chart. They will then ask you to read out
            the letters from the largest at the top, going down, until you
            either reach the bottom or cannot see the letters clearly.
            <br /><br />
            The optometrist will then proceed to determine your prescription by
            having you look at the chart using a set of lenses. You will test
            each eye individually and then together. The test should take around
            5 minutes and it should not cause any discomfort. This test will be
            conducted by an optometrist as part of your routine eye exam,
            alongside other testing such as a slit lamp test.
          </p>

          <h2 class="topMargin">
            How do you interpret the results of a visual acuity test?
          </h2>
          <p>
            After testing your visual acuity with the Snellen Chart, your
            results will be recorded as a ratio. The first number of the ratio
            represents the distance at which the letters are being read, 20 feet
            or 6 metres, and the second number represents the line of letters
            you can read to.
            <br /><br />
            If you can see objects clearly from 20 feet away, this will be
            expressed as 20/20 meaning you have normal visual acuity. In
            Australia, this will likely be referred to as 6/6, meaning 6 metres,
            as we use the metric system. 6/12 is another ratio you may come
            across in your results if you have poorer vision. It means you can
            see an object from 6 metres away, that others with better vision
            could see from further back at 12 metres.
            <br /><br />

          <h2>Can you use a Snellen Chart at home?</h2>
          <p>
            It is possible to use a Snellen Chart at home. There are plenty of
            printable tests to be found online. However, home eye tests are not
            reliable and can provide inaccurate results. If you need an eye test
            of any kind, it is best to book an appointment with an optometrist.
            They will perform a visual acuity test, which may include the use of
            a Snellen Chart, LogMAR chart, or ETDRS chart, and interpret the
            results correctly.
