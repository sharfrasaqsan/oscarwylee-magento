            Eye health is important at all ages but as we get older, our eyes
            need more care and attention. Whether that’s annual eye tests or
            multifocal fittings, Oscar Wylee has trained optometrists to take
            care of your eye health needs. We also have a wide range of
            affordable frames, from clean and sophisticated to quirky
            statements.

            Our optometrists are trained to deal with age-related eye problems
            and to provide appropriate care. Below are some of the services we
            offer.

              <h3>Bulk billed eye test</h3>
              <p>
                We provide bulk billed comprehensive eye tests for eligible
                Medicare cardholders. If you are over 65 years old, we recommend
                you have a yearly review with one of our qualified optometrists.

              <h3>RMS eye test</h3>
              <p>
                Optometrists are able to perform vision tests to determine a
                person’s ability to hold a motor vehicle driving license. They
                can also fill in the required paperwork. This is not covered
                under Medicare and will incur a fee.

              <h3>Visual field test</h3>
              <p>
                A Visual Field Test (VFT) is used to quantify the peripheral
                vision of each eye individually. This test helps your
                optometrist establish a baseline and diagnose ocular diseases,
                including glaucoma.

                  >visual field test</a
                >
                is beneficial for people who have progressive eye diseases, and
                neurological conditions affecting their visual fields, as well
                as monocular drivers who need to fit certain criteria to
                continue driving.

          <h2>Our Lenses</h2>
          <p>
            At Oscar Wylee, we offer a wide range of lens options to suit your
            visual needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Multifocal lenses</h3>
          <p>
            Multifocals are a convenient solution for people who have trouble
            seeing both close-up and far away by including multiple
            prescriptions in one lens. Get the best of both worlds with our
            selection of
            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/multifocal-lenses.html"
              class="linkTo"
              >multifocal lenses</a
            >
            , customised to your needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Bifocal glasses</h3>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/guides/lenses/bifocal.html"
              class="linkTo"
              >Bifocals</a
            >
            are designed for people who struggle with near and distance vision.
            These glasses have lenses that split into two defined segments
            containing two prescriptions, so you don’t have to swap between
            different glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>Reading glasses</h3>
          <p>
            Reading glasses are a solution to an age-related eye condition known
            as presbyopia. They magnify nearby objects, giving you the ability
            to read a book or do close-range activities comfortably without
            blurry vision or eye strain.
            <br /><br />
            You may be familiar with over-the-counter reading glasses that have
            a preset magnification strength and the same prescription in both
            lenses. While these are less expensive, they do not provide full
            correction for individuals. That is why we recommend you choose a
            pair of
            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/reading_glasses.html"
              class="linkTo"
              >reading glasses</a
            >
            from Oscar Wylee as we make them custom to your face and
            prescription needs.
          </p>

          <h3>High index lenses</h3>
          <p>
            If you wear glasses with a strong prescription, it may be beneficial
            to invest in high index lenses. High-index lenses are designed to
            bend light more efficiently compared to regular lenses, which as a
            result allows the lenses to be thinner and lighter, making them more
            comfortable for daily use.
