                <p>
                  The profession of ophthalmology is different from optometry
                  because it requires a medical degree as ophthalmologists
                  perform surgery.
                  <br /><br />
                  Optometry deals with primary eye care and conditions and
                  anything that is outside the scope of an optometrist, the
                  patient is then referred to an ophthalmologist.
