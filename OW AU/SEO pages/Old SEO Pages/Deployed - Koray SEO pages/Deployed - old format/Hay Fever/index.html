            Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, is an allergic reaction
            to pollens, moulds, animal dander and dust mites, which are all
            environmental allergens. It affects much of the population and is
            more common in certain seasons.

            Hay fever is a common allergic reaction to environmental allergens

            Hay fever most commonly causes nasal issues such as a runny nose,
            coughing or sneezing. It can also cause an itchy nose, throat or
            roof of the mouth. Hay fever can also cause symptoms that can affect
            your eyes. The symptoms of hay fever are listed below.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Hay fever is caused by triggers such as tree and grass pollen, dust
            mites and spores from mould and fungi. When these substances enter
            your body, the immune system identifies them as harmful, releasing
            chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream, which causes hay
            fever symptoms.

            Unlike the common cold, hay fever can last for weeks or even months,

          <h2>When is hay fever season in Australia?</h2>
          <p>
            The typical time for hay fever season in Australia is from August to
            March, sometimes even up to May depending on the type of grass. This
            is due to increased pollen that is released in the air from trees
            and grass.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you get hay fever in winter?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, you can get hay fever any time of the year depending on the
            allergens you are allergic to. While pollen is most common in spring
            and summertime, you can also get hay fever from substances that can
            occur in winter, or all year round, such as dust mites, mould and
            pet dander.
          </p>

          <h2 class="topMargin">When to see a doctor?</h2>
          <p>
            Hay fever can usually be managed with home remedies and medication,
            but you should speak to a doctor if you cannot find any relief from
            the symptoms or if you have another condition that can aggravate
            your hay fever symptoms, such as asthma.
          </p>

          <h3>How is hay fever diagnosed?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Hay fever can be diagnosed by a health care provider who can
            prescribe your treatment options. A doctor can provide a diagnosis
            for hay fever in three main ways.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Exam:</b> A doctor may examine your nose, eyes and throat for
              hay fever.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Allergy test:</b> An allergy test is the most common way of
              diagnosing hay fever. It involves a blood or skin prick test.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Patient history:</b> You can be diagnosed with hay fever by
              describing your symptoms to the doctor and the times that these
              allergic reactions occur.

          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              No, hay fever is not contagious. It is caused by an allergic
              reaction to certain environmental allergens such as mould, pollen
              and dust mites.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="collapsible">Can you develop hay fever?</h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              Hay fever can develop at any age but it most commonly starts when
              you are in your childhood and teenage years. Those with a family
              history of allergies are more likely to develop hay fever.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="collapsible">Why do I get hay fever at night?</h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              Some people find that their hay fever gets worse at night. This
              means you could be allergic to dust mites which can be on your
              bedding and other materials in your home such as the carpet and
              curtains.
              <br /><br />
              If you are struggling with hay fever at night, investing in
              hypoallergenic bedding might be a good idea as dust mites cannot
              survive in those conditions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="collapsible">Can you cure hay fever permanently?</h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              Unfortunately, because hay fever is an allergy, you cannot
              permanently cure it. While it cannot be cured, there are ways you
              can manage and relieve the symptoms of hay fever.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="collapsible">Can you prevent hay fever?</h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              While there is no cure for hay fever, you can minimise the
              symptoms by taking mast cell stabilisers a couple of weeks prior
              to allergy season to reduce your bodyâ€™s reaction to the
              environmental allergens.
