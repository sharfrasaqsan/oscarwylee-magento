          <h1>What is an Optical Dispenser (Optician) and What Do They Do?</h1>
          <p>
            When it comes to eye care, there are often a team of professionals
            who work together to make sure you are getting the best services
            possible. If you are getting a regular eye test, you will be more
            than familiar with an optometrist and what they do. If you have ever
            had a more serious eye problem, like advanced glaucoma or cataracts,
            you will be familiar with an ophthalmologist, also known as an eye
            surgeon.
            <br /><br />
            If you have ever had glasses fitted, then you will have worked with
            a dispensing optician, although you may not have known it, as they
            often have a different name. In Australia, we have chosen to use the
            term optical dispenser instead of optician, as it is less likely to
            get confused with an optometrist.
            <br /><br />
            Keep reading to find out more about optical dispensers, why we use
            this term in Australia and what role optical dispensers play in your
            eye care team.

              <p>
                An optical dispenser is an eye care professional who is
                responsible for fitting and dispensing glasses. The term
                optician originated in the UK, where it relates to eye care
                professionals who both prescribe and dispense glasses.
                <br /><br />
                As this definition is very closely related to optometry and is
                often confused for it, optician is not a term we use in
                Australia. We instead use the terms
                <a

                  >optometrists</a
                >
                and optical dispensers to differentiate between those who
                perform eye exams and prescribe lenses (optometrists), and those
                who interpret prescriptions and assist customers with fitting
                their glasses (optical dispensers).

          <h2>What does an optical dispenser do?</h2>
          <p>
            An optical dispenser has a range of responsibilities. These include
            fitting corrective lenses for patients, measuring the distance
            between a patient's pupils to ensure the best fit for glasses, and
            offering advice on selecting the right frames. Optical dispensers do
            not prescribe glasses or diagnose eye conditions.
            <br /><br />
            Optical dispensers play an important role in helping an optometrist
            and

            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, we have a dedicated and passionate team of eye care
            professionals in store that can help with your vision needs. If you
            need an eye test for instance,

              >you can book online</a
            >
            and our optometrists, optical dispensers and front of house staff,
            will work together to sort out any prescriptions or eye care that
            you need.

          <h3>What does an optical dispenser do on a daily basis?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            What an optical dispenser will do day to day is dependent upon what
            environment they work in. If they work in an optical dispensary,
            their responsibilities will include filling prescriptions, adjusting
            frames and lenses, and giving advice to patients. If they work at an
            optometrists office, they will perform similar duties, but may work
            closer with an eye care team including the optometrists. An optical
            dispenser may also work in other eye care centres or even
            laboratories.

            They will make sure everyoneâ€™s eye care needs are met by fitting
            glasses, giving advice and making adjustments to lenses or frames.

          <h2>How to become an optical dispenser?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            To start a career as an optical dispenser, you are required to
            attain a qualification in the optometry field. You will also need
            the appropriate technical training to develop practical skills.

              <h3>What do you need to study to become an optical dispenser?</h3>

              <p>
                You will need to complete a course to become an optical
                dispenser. In Australia, The Australasian College of Optical
                Dispensing (ACOD) offers a Certificate IV in Optical Dispensing
                which will provide you with the necessary qualifications.
                <br /><br />
                You could also complete the training via an institution like
                TAFE NSW, that offers the same certificate. This schooling and
                training is followed by a period of work experience or an
                apprenticeship to get hands on knowledge.

              <h3>How long does it take to become an optical dispenser?</h3>
              <p class="minusPadding">
                To become an optical dispenser, it will take up to two years.
                The completion of a Certificate IV in Optical Dispensing for
                instance, can take anywhere from 12 to 18 months. If you study
                part time, it may take longer. You will then do the required
                work experience before entering into the workplace as an optical
                dispenser.
