          <h1>What Is Bulk Billing?</h1>
          <p>
            Bulk billing is a payment option created to provide monetary
            coverage for public healthcare needs. With bulk billing, you may
            receive pay advantages or complete coverage when you see healthcare
            professionals like a doctor or an optometrist.
          </p>

          <h2>How does bulk billing work?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Bulk billing, as defined by Health Direct, is a part of the
            Australian Government’s health coverage system called Medicare.
            Medicare coverage means that in specific and stated circumstances,
            the Australian health system will completely or partially pay for a
            medical service provided.
            <br /><br />
            This service is called bulk billing because GPs and healthcare
            providers bill the Medicare system in bulk. This means they bill the
            services in one massive instance at a time.
            <br /><br />
            Bulk billed eye tests are available to all eligible Medicare card
            holders at Oscar Wylee.

          <h3>What is a gap fee?</h3>
          <p>
            When bulk billing doesn’t cover the entire cost of any form of
            health care, you will have to pay part of the fee out of your own
            pocket. This is what is referred to as a gap payment, or gap fee.

                Medicare is Australia’s ‘universal health care system’. It was
                created on the 1st of February in 1984. It is a national health
                scheme that is managed by Services Australia. The system was
                created to assist Australian citizens pay for the cost of their
                health and welfare.
                <br /><br />
                Proof of Medicare enrollment is found on an issued card that
                lists each member of a household or group that may get Medicare
                benefits. Bring this car with you to our stores for the most

              <h3>Medicare claims online</h3>
              <p>
                You can also make any Medicare or bulk billing claims online
                through Medicare easyclaim or other digital sites that allow a
                customer to sign an online form.
                <br /><br />
                Be advised, there is a strong possibility that without directly
                using a Medicare card in person, any payments made will be
                directly charged to you. Keeping this card with you is vital to
                receive any bulk billed benefits.

            Services Australia also included an eye test as performed by a
            qualified optometrist in Medicare’s coverage for health services. As
            vision skills are constantly changing, it’s recommended that you
            take advantage of this feature.
            <br /><br />
            However, general Medicare eye health care is limited to eye tests
            and eye exams. Bulk billing eye tests can also apply to dependents
            and their own vision testing, such as a kid’s eye test booking.

          <h2>Why would doctors choose not to bulk bill?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Bulk billing can often result in GPs or health practitioners
            receiving less payment. According to The Royal Australian College of
            General Practitioners, an overuse of bulk billing can cause a
            revenue loss for certain clinics. Because of this, it is possible
            that bulk billing services may not be accepted or are outright
            refused across Australia.
            <br /><br />
            It is recommended that you use Health Directs

          <h2>How much do you get back on Medicare?</h2>
          <p>
            The government will typically pay your Medicare benefits towards
            your chosen bank account. The amount that a Medicare member gets
            back depends on multiple factors, such as the service used, the
            member’s state of finances and living and if there are dependents on
            the Medicare card, and how many dependents there are.
          </p>

          <h2 class="topMargin">
            What is the difference between bulk billing and private billing?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Private billing refers to payments on medical aid that are paid out
            of your own pocket instead of going through a third party. It also
            includes payments made in advance or costs made with the Medicare
            rebate to be used at a later date.
            <br /><br />
            If a doctor or other professional has billed you for a payment even
            though Medicare has covered a portion of the cost, then that means
            they technically did the payment as private or mixed billing.
            <br /><br />
            ‘Mixed billing’ is the term used for when both private and bulk
            billing have been applied to any payments.
          </p>

          <h2 class="topMargin">Who is eligible for bulk billing?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            All valid Medicare card holders and their dependants are eligible
            for bulk billing and bulk billed services.
            <br /><br />
            Medicare resources are only available for:

            appliances like hearing aids. Medicare will also not cover for laser

            Medicare does not pay or cover for any benefits on glasses, frames,
            lenses, or any other optical appliances.
          </p>

          <h3>Claiming with health funds</h3>
          <p>
            Australian health insurance companies offer coverage on hospital
            extras and general extras, including dental extras and optical
            extras. Optical extras enable claiming on prescription glasses when
            you are a member of a health fund.
            <br /><br />
            This coverage mainly applies to glasses and other purchases. Unless
            packaged with a general extra policy, hospital extras may not allow
            similar coverage on corrective prescriptions.
