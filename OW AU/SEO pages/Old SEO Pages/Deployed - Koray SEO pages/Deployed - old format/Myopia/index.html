          <p>
            Myopia, also known as nersightedness or shortsightedness, is a
            condition in which the eye struggles to focus on objects at a far
            distance. Near distance vision will generally remain clear. Myopia
            is a refractive error in which light entering the eye does not focus
            on the retina properly. Myopia can be corrected by prescription
            glasses. Laser eye surgery is also an option, however, not everyone
            will be suitable for this procedure.
            <br /><br />Keep reading to find out more about myopia, what the
            symptoms are, and how it can be treated.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Myopia (nearsightedness) is an eye condition in which a person will
            have trouble seeing objects at a far distance, with their vision
            often blurry when they try to focus. Generally, near vision will
            remain clear unless affected by a different vision issue.
            <br /><br />
            Myopia is one of the most prevalent eye conditions in the world.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Night myopia refers to the eye’s inability to see far objects at
            night time, or under low light conditions. Night myopia occurs when
            the eye struggles to focus the wavelengths of light that occur at
            night time or in dull light conditions, onto the retina.
            <br /><br />
            Night myopia can affect people who already have general
            nearsightedness, as well as those without. People who have a very
            small amount of nearsightedness or average vision, may also struggle
            to focus these light wavelengths onto the retina.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Myopia (nearsightedness) is a refractive error in which the eye does
            not bend light properly, resulting in blurred images. When the light
            enters the eye, it goes through the cornea and lens, to focus on the
            retina. If someone has myopia, there is generally a problem with the
            cornea or the lens, for instance the eyeball may be too long or the
            cornea may be abnormally shaped. When light enters the eye of
            someone with myopia, the light will focus in front of the retina, as
            opposed to on the retina , causing blurred distance vision.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Myopia (nearsightedness), is a condition that can affect all people,
            including adults and children. However, there are several factors
            that may increase the likelihood of developing myopia
            (nearsightedness). They are as listed below.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Genetics:</b> Research has found that people who have a parent
              that has myopia are at higher risk of developing the eye
              condition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Time spent outdoors:</b> A lack of sunlight and time spent
              outdoors has been cited as a possible contributing factor towards
              myopia.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Near work:</b> People who spend extended periods of time
              conducting near work, such as reading or working on a computer,
              may be more likely to develop myopia. It is recommended that
              intense near work and screen time should be limited to less than 2
              hours a day for school aged children.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Age:</b> Children who develop myopia at a young age, may be at

              <p class="minusPadding">
                Blue light is emitted from the sun which is known as natural
                blue light and is found in the electromagnetic spectrum. The
                blue light that is produced by screens is artificial and can
                also come from LED light bulbs, potentially affecting your sleep
                and causing eye strain.
                <br /><br />
                The blue light that is naturally occurring from the sun is used
                by your body to help regulate its sleep-wake cycle. It does this
                by producing the hormone melatonin at night in the absence of
                natural light.

              <p class="minusPadding">
                Myopia (nearsightedness) can not be fully cured, with treatment
                instead aiming to correct this refractive issue and slow the
                progression of symptoms. The most common treatment for myopia
                includes corrective lenses and laser eye surgery, both designed
                to help the light entering the eye focus on the retina.
                <br /><br />
                The lenses to correct myopia will be concave in shape, helping
                the light that enters the eye to focus on the retina. The pros
                of corrective lenses for myopia are their convenience. All a
                person needs to do is book in for an eye test, and an
                optometrist will give you a prescription for a pair of glasses
                that can help manage the symptoms of myopia. The con of
                corrective lenses for myopia is that once you take your glasses
                off, your vision issues will remain.

            Laser eye surgery, the most commonly known procedure being LASIK, is
            another treatment option for myopia. This surgery aims to reshape
            the structure of the eye and help the light entering to focus where
            it is supposed to. The pros of laser eye surgery include a reduction
            in myopia symptoms such as blurred far vision, which also means a
            person will not be so dependent on corrective glasses. The main con
            of laser eye surgery is that not everyone will be eligible to
            receive this surgery. Patients who have had this surgery may also
            suffer from increased dry eye symptoms and halos around lights,
            especially when driving at night. <br /><br />

          <h3>Can myopia (nearsightedness) be cured naturally?</h3>
          <p>
            As myopia (nearsightedness) is caused by a structural problem within
            the eye, there is no natural cure or home remedy that will correct
            this vision issue. The appropriate treatment for myopia is
            corrective glasses or a procedure such as laser eye surgery. If you

            Myopia (nearsightedness) vs Hyperopia (farsightedness)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Myopia and hyperopia are two eye conditions often spoken about
            together, as they are similar in nature. Both myopia and hyperopia
            are caused by refractive errors that cause light to focus on the
            wrong area of the retina. Myopia is caused when light focuses before
            the retina, leading to far vision issues. With hyperopia on the
            other hand, the light focuses behind the retina, causing issues with
            near vision.
            <br /><br />
            You can not have myopia and hyperopia in the same eye at the same
            time. If myopia is severe enough, it may affect near vision, but
            this does not necessarily mean you have hyperopia.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Myopia (nearsightedness) is a condition that affects children as
            well as adults. Myopia is often diagnosed in school aged children
            and can continue into adulthood. However, if diagnosed early,
            treatment may be able to help slow the progression of myopia, so it
            does not affect a child’s sight severely in adulthood.
            <br /><br />
            Risk factors for children developing myopia include a parent with
            myopia. A child with one parent who has myopia, may be up to 2 times
            more likely to develop myopia. A child with two myopic parents can
            be up to 5 times more likely to develop myopia. Another risk factor
            for myopia in kids is a lack of time spent outdoors, in natural
            sunlight.

          <h2>Myopia (nearsightedness) complications</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            People with high levels of myopia (nearsightedness) may be at an
            increased risk of developing further vision issues and health
            conditions, due to this refractive error. Some of the potential
            vision issues are listed below.
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Glaucoma:</b> Glaucoma refers to a group of eye diseases,
              caused when the optic nerve is damaged. One of the main symptoms
              of glaucoma is vision loss. Myopia may increase the risk of
              developing glaucoma.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cataracts:</b> Cataracts refers to the clouding of the eye’s
              lens. This causes blurred vision and can impact quality of life.
              People with myopia may be at a higher risk of developing cataracts
              at an earlier age than those without.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Retinal damage:</b> Myopia can cause damage to the retina,
              including tears and retina detachment, which may cause vision
              loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Macular degeneration:</b> Is an eye disease in which the
              macular is damaged, causing central vision loss. Those with myopia
              may be at a higher risk of developing macular degeneration.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It is important that you maintain your eye test appointments with
            your optometrist so myopia can be monitored and treated
            appropriately.

          <p>
            If you think you may have myopia (nearsightedness), you should book
            in to have an eye test with an optometrist. During an eye test, your
            optometrist will be able to examine your eyes and determine if you
