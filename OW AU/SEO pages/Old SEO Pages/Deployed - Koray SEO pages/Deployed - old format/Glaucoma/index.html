          <h1>Glaucoma - Definition, Types, Symptoms, Treatment</h1>
          <p>
            Glaucoma is a group of eye problems that can cause irreversible
            vision loss, caused by damage to the optic nerve. It is the world’s
            leading cause of blindness and often has no symptoms to begin with,
            which makes regular eye tests crucial for diagnosis and early
            detection.
            <br /><br />

          <h2>What is glaucoma?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            According to Glaucoma Australia, 300,000 Australians are affected by
            glaucoma and 50% of people with glaucoma don’t know they have it.
            This eye disease causes a loss of peripheral vision (visual field
            loss) through damage to the optic nerve, resulting from issues with
            the eye’s intraocular fluid drainage system. It can eventually lead
            to complete vision loss and it can occur in either one eye or both
            eyes.

          <h2>What causes glaucoma?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Glaucoma is caused by damage to the optic nerve which is often
            associated with high eye pressure. There are certain risk factors
            that can make a person more likely to develop glaucoma. Common risk
            factors of glaucoma are listed below.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Older age</li>
            <li>Family history of glaucoma, especially siblings</li>
            <li>Thin corneas</li>
            <li>Corticosteroid medication</li>
            <li>Ethnicity</li>
            <li>Are near or far sighted</li>
            <li>Has had an eye injury or operation</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What are the symptoms of glaucoma?</h2>
          <p>
            For most people, there are usually no symptoms at all for glaucoma
            which makes early detection quite difficult, that is why regular eye
            tests are extremely important in taking care of your eye health.
            <br /><br />
            In advanced, severe glaucoma, tunnel vision can occur which results
            in misjudging or missing objects off to the side as well as mobility
            issues. In acute angle closure glaucoma, symptoms include pain, red
            eyes, headaches, blurry vision, halos around lights and nausea.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the first sign of glaucoma?</h3>
          <p>
            The first sign of glaucoma is the loss of peripheral vision, which
            is what you can see out of the sides of your vision. Other signs
            include seeing halos, developed sensitivity to light or sudden
            vision loss.

            Glaucoma can be treated in four main ways, anti-glaucoma medication,
            prescription eye drops, laser treatment and surgery. The benefits of
            these treatments are listed below.

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Anti-glaucoma medication - </b>Includes tablets and eye drops
              and can be used to treat open-angle glaucoma, although
              effectiveness can reduce over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Prescription eye drops - </b>A common treatment that prevents
              optic nerve damage by lowering eye pressure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Laser treatment - </b>Laser can be used to make the fluid in
              the eye flow more effectively, reducing pressure on the optic
              nerve.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Surgery - </b>May be suggested if the previous methods, laser
              and medication, are not effective for the patient. It is also a
              treatment for more advanced or aggressive glaucoma.

                It is thought that 50% of people with glaucoma don’t know that
                they have it, so having regular eye examinations is important
                for early detection. Your optometrist can perform the following
                tests to assess for glaucoma:

              <p>
                If your optometrist suspects that you have glaucoma, you will be

          <p class="minusPadding">
            While glaucoma is not preventable, there are certain measures you
            can take to stop the damage and protect your vision, diminishing its
            effects. These include getting regular eye test as early detection
            for glaucoma is extremely important, wearing eye protection,
            especially when using power tools, and being aware of your family
            history as glaucoma can run in the family.

              <b>Open angle glaucoma: </b>Is most commonly seen and makes up 90%
              of cases. It is usually slowly progressive, caused by a blockage
              in the eye’s intraocular fluid drainage system resulting in
              elevated eye pressure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Acute angle closure glaucoma: </b>A sudden narrowing of the
              eye’s intraocular fluid drainage system causes a build-up of eye
              pressure. It needs urgent treatment as there is a high risk of
              vision loss

              <b>Congenital glaucoma: </b>Is rare, present at birth and early

            The rate at which glaucoma progress is different for everyone and

            Can you have glaucoma without going blind?
          </h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              Yes, if glaucoma is caught early by an eye care professional, it
              doesn’t have to lead to blindness. There are also factors outside
              of your control that determine how quickly or if blindness occurs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="collapsible">
            Can you have high eye pressure and not have glaucoma?
          </h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              Yes, glaucoma is not always caused by high eye pressure. Even
              people with normal eye pressure can still develop glaucoma. Eye
              pressure can also vary from person to person, someone’s normal eye
              pressure could be high for another.

          <h3 class="collapsible">Is glaucoma hereditary?</h3>
          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              Yes, glaucoma is hereditary. While you can still develop glaucoma
              without a family history, according to Glaucoma Australia, you are
              ten times more likely to develop glaucoma if a direct member of
              your family has this eye disease. You also have an almost 1 in 4
              chance of developing glaucoma if you have first-degree relatives
              with glaucoma.

          <div class="expandContent">
            <p>
              No, unfortunately, there is no cure for glaucoma. While glaucoma
              cannot be cured, there are still ways you can manage this disease
              such as with medication or surgery.
