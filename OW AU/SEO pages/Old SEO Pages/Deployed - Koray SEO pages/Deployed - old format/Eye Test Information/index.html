          <h2>What is an eye test?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            An eye test is a procedure in which an optometrist will check your
            eyes to assess your vision. Eye tests are hugely important in
            helping to
            <a href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/eye-care.html" class="linkTo"
              >maintain your eye health</a
            >, as they can detect a wide range of vision issues and eye
            diseases. These can include:
          </p>
          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>Myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness).</li>
            <li>Astigmatism.</li>
            <li>Glaucoma.</li>
            <li>Cataracts</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Getting a regular eye test will allow your optometrist to diagnose
            and treat these conditions early on, so they do not become a bigger
            problem down the track. Even if you feel like your vision is clear,
            it is important to get your eyes tested regularly. <br /><br />
            If you need an eye test, you can book online and our Oscar Wylee
            optometrists will be happy to conduct your eye test.

          <h2>What can an eye test tell me about my health?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            here are several health conditions that present symptoms within the
            eye, including diabetes and high blood pressure. This means that
            having a regular eye test may be able to help detect these issues
            and give an indication of your general health. Other health
            conditions that may be detected in an eye test include:
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>Cardiovascular disease.</li>
            <li>Thyroid disease.</li>
            <li>Rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Whilst a routine eye test may pick these conditions up, it is always
            best to speak with your doctor if you believe you have any health
            issues.

                At Oscar Wylee, your comprehensive eye exam will include a
                variety of tests to ensure we can diagnose and treat any vision
                issues appropriately. You will first undergo a series of
                pre-tests, sometimes called diagnostic tests, with an optical
                assistant. This may include the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tonometry test - during this test, a machine will blow small
                  puffs of air into your eyes. This test will measure
                  intraocular eye pressure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A digital photograph may be taken of your eye, which can be
                  used in later appointments to assess how your eye is changing.

                <li>
                  Slit lamp test- this test assesses your eye health, by
                  examining the anterior and posterior of the eye such as your
                  cornea and iris.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Refraction or vision test- during this test, an optometrist
                  will have you look at an image through different lenses,
                  asking you to decide which helps you see clearer.

          <ul>
            <li class="minusPadding">
              <strong>Visual field test -</strong> This test is used to assess
              your peripheral vision. It is particularly useful for detecting
              glaucoma, which is a condition that can cause vision loss
            </li>

            <li class="minusPadding">
              <strong>Dilated Fundus Exam -</strong> This test enables the
              optometrist to evaluate your eye health in more detail, by
              obtaining a clear view of the retina. This test is normally done
              for those with diabetes and those at risk of retinal damage, such
              as tears and holes.

          <p class="addPaddingBottom">
            At Oscar Wylee, we allocate approximately 20 minutes for each eye
            test. However, this time frame can vary, especially for those who
            have more complex eye conditions that require more extensive
            testing.
          </p>

          <h2>What happens during an eye test?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            During our eye tests at Oscar Wylee, we undertake a series of
            simple, time efficient steps to complete your examination.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              You need to first book an eye test with us. You can

                >do this online</a
              >
              or visit your nearest store to make an appointment. Fill out your
              details correctly and make sure to bring your old glasses,
              medicare or health fund card if you have them.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you arrive, you will be checked in and asked for your medical
              history, family medical history, why you are here, what concerns
              you have, any symptoms and any existing prescriptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before you see your optometrist, you will complete pre-testing
              with one of our optical assistants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once finished with these diagnostic tests, you will see an
              optometrist. The optometrist will conduct their own tests.
            </li>
            <li>
              When all the tests have been completed, your optometrist will
              discuss your results with you, and make recommendations for
              prescriptions or further treatment if needed.
            </li>
            <li class="addPaddingBottom">
              Our friendly staff will then take over to discuss lens options and
              help you choose a pair of glasses. Dispensing for new glasses
              often takes 2-3 weeks.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>How often do I need an eye test?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            If you are under 65 years old, it is recommended that you have a
            routine eye test every 2 years. If you are over 65 years old, then a
            yearly review is ideal. If you have a condition like diabetes, you
            will likely need eye tests more frequently.

            <br /><br />
            You may also need an eye test if you have noticed any vision
            changes. These can include:
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>Blurred, double or cloudy vision.</li>
            <li>Eye strain.</li>

          <h3>When to get my child’s eyes tested?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            It is recommended that you get your child’s eyes tested before

            suggestion of an optometrist.

            It is important to note that despite these recommendations, not all

            It is possible to test your eyesight at home, using an online test
            or printed eye chart, such as a Snellen Chart. However, home eye
            tests are not always accurate and the results can be misleading.
            <br /><br />
            If you feel like you are having vision problems and need an eye
            test, it is important that you book an appointment with an
            optometrist for accurate results and appropriate treatment.
