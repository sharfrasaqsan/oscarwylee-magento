          <h1>Blue Light Glasses for Kids</h1>
          <p>
            Blue light glasses are used to block artificial blue light emitted
            from digital screens such as a computer or phone. With children
            spending more time on screens, whether that’s due to remote learning
            or using tablets and phones at a younger age, the use of blue light
            glasses has become very popular for kids.

          <p>
            Blue light glasses, also known as blue light blocking glasses and
            anti-blue light glasses, are worn to block artificial blue light
            produced by digital screens. The glasses are able to block the blue
            light as they have an add-on filter applied to the lens, which may
            help protect your eyes. Other add-ons you can apply to lenses

              <p class="minusPadding">
                Blue light is emitted from the sun which is known as natural
                blue light and is found in the electromagnetic spectrum. The
                blue light that is produced by screens is artificial and can
                also come from LED light bulbs, potentially affecting your sleep
                and causing eye strain.
                <br /><br />
                The blue light that is naturally occurring from the sun is used
                by your body to help regulate its sleep-wake cycle. It does this
                by producing the hormone melatonin at night in the absence of
                natural light.

            While blue light glasses are effective at blocking artificial blue
            light that is emitted from screens, the research is still early to
            conclusively say they are successful in protecting your eyes from
            harm. Although there is strong evidence that it is beneficial for
            sleep regulation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention (CDC), exposure to blue light can make it difficult to
            fall and stay asleep by affecting your circadian rhythm.

            If your child is on a computer for much of their day, whether that’s
            for school or entertainment, they could benefit from blue light
            glasses. There is research that supports artificial blue light
            interfering with sleep. Sleep is extremely important for a child’s
            healthy development, therefore, it may be a good idea to invest in a
            pair of blue light glasses for your child if much of their day is
            spent on a screen.
