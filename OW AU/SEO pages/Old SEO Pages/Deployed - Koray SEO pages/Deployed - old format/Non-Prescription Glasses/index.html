          <h1>Non-Prescription Glasses</h1>
          <p>
            Itâ€™s likely that just about everyone has heard of the term
            prescription glasses. If you or someone you know has needed vision
            correction, an optometrist will have prescribed you these glasses.
            <br /><br />
            But did you know that there are also non-prescriptions glasses?
            These glasses may not correct vision issues like normal optical
            glasses, but they can still be an important part of taking care of
            your eyes.
            <br /><br />
            Keep reading to find out more about non-prescription glasses and
            which ones we provide here at Oscar Wylee.

          <h2>What are non-prescription glasses?</h2>
          <div class="flexContainer">
            <div class="flexText">
              <p>
                To understand what non-prescription glasses are, it may be
                beneficial to first define what prescription glasses are, so we
                can clearly see the difference between the two.
                <br /><br />
                Prescription glasses are optical glasses that contain a powered
                lens. This power or prescription, is determined by an
                optometrist during an eye test, and will help correct a vision
                issue such as nearsightedness.
                <br /><br />
                Non-prescription glasses are the opposite. Non-prescription
                glasses do not have any magnification power or prescription in
                the lens. The lenses in non-prescription glasses are sometimes
                referred to as plano lenses and will not provide any vision
                correction. Though they have no power, this does not mean that
                non-prescription glasses are not an important part of helping
                you to maintain your eye health.

          <h2>Why do you need non-prescription glasses?</h2>

          <p>
            You may be wondering what the point of non-prescriptions glasses
            are, if they do not provide any vision correction. Non-prescription
            glasses can actually be hugely useful to your eye care. At Oscar
            Wylee, the exact benefits of non-prescription glasses will depend on
            the type you get.
          </p>

          <h2 class="TopMargin">Types of non-prescription glasses</h2>
          <p>
            At Oscar Wylee, we provide two main types of non-prescription
            glasses; sunglasses and blue light filter glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>Sunglasses</h3>
          <p>
            Whilst some people may have prescription sunglasses, many wearers
            will be sporting a non-prescription, plano lens that are polarised
            or have a tint. Both types of sunglasses are effective in helping to
            protect your eyes from damaging UV light and other potentially
            harmful factors such as glare, wind and rain.
          </p>

          <div class="flexContainer">
            <div class="flexText">
              <h4>Tinted Sunglasses</h4>
              <p>
                Tinted sunglasses have a lens that is pigmented with tinted dye
                solution. Tinted lenses reduce light and provide protection
                against UV and HEV rays. HEV rays are also known as blue light.
                Whilst blue light is found in digital devices, it is also
                emitted from the sun, along with UV rays, both of which can be
                harmful to your eyes.
                <br /><br />
                At Oscar Wylee we sell category 2 and category 3 tinted lenses.
                These tints come in green, brown and grey colouring.
                <br /><br />
                Category 2 tinted lenses provide good UV protection and help cut
                glare from the sun. They are suitable under dull light
                conditions, including night driving. These sunglasses are also
                available in a gradient tint, in which the lens fades from 80%
                tint to a 20% tint.
                <br /><br />
                Category 3 tints provide high protection against sun glare and
                provide good UV protection. They are <b>not</b> suitable for
                driving at night time or in dull light conditions.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flexText">
              <h4>Polarised Sunglasses</h4>
              <p class="minusPadding">
                Polarised sunglasses have a coating applied to the lens that
                helps to give an extra layer of light filtration, one that
                tinted sunglasses do not have.
              </p>

              </span>

              <p>
                Polarised sunglasses are effective in eliminating reflective
                glare. They work to remove the sheen and reflection from water,
                roads and pathways. Polarised glasses also help enhance your
                visual comfort by reducing eye strain, and in the case of brown
                polarised lenses, can naturally filter blue light or HEV rays.
                <br /><br />
                Note: Depending on your prescription, polarisation may not be
                available with other lens options. Ask our knowledgeable team
                in-store what works best for your prescription.
                <br /><br />
                At Oscar Wylee, our sunglasses come in a range of styles, from
                aviator to cat eye, catering for all fashion tastes. You can
                also have your Oscar Wylee sunglasses with or without an optical
                prescription or with

          <h3>Blue light filter glasses</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Blue light glasses are non-prescription glasses that have a blue
            light filter applied to the plano lens. The aim of the blue light
            filter is to limit the negative effects of long-term blue light
            exposure.
            <br /><br />
            Blue light is a type of light that is emitted from digital devices,
            including smartphones and computers. Prolonged exposure to blue
            light may have negative effects on your eye, and overall health.
            These include:
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>Eye strain</li>
            <li>Disrupted sleep</li>
            <li>Poor sleep quality</li>
            <li>Blurry vision</li>
            <li>Headaches</li>
            <li>Dry eyes</li>
            <li>Light sensitivity</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Blue light filter glasses provide protection from this light and
            help to reduce some of these effects. At Oscar Wylee, you can have
            blue light glasses with or without a prescription.
