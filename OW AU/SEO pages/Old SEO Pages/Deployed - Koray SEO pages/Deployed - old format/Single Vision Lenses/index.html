            Single vision lenses have one prescription over the lens surface. If
            you need help seeing at a single distance, such as close up, these
            lenses may help provide the appropriate vision correction.

          <h2>What are single vision lenses?</h2>
          <p>
            Single vision lenses are a type of glasses lens that have one power,
            or prescription, over the whole surface of the lens. Depending on
            the prescription, single vision lenses can provide correction for
            distance vision or near vision.

          <h2>When are single vision lenses prescribed?</h2>
          <p>
            Single vision lenses will often be prescribed to people who require
            a single vision correction. If you have trouble with close work for
            instance, which includes reading small text at a near distance, you
            may be prescribed reading glasses. Reading glasses are a single
            vision lens that are powered to correct issues such as
            longsightedness (hyperopia), presbyopia, an age related condition in
            which your eyes struggle to focus on close objects, and may also
            relieve eye strain for those who engage in frequent screen work.

            <br /><br />
            Single vision lenses may also be prescribed if you have trouble
            seeing things far away. These lenses will have one prescription to
            correct short-sightedness (nearsightedness) and help people see
            things in the distance.

              <p class="topSmallMargin">
                Unlike single vision lenses, bifocal lenses can correct
                short-sightedness and long-sightedness, within the one pair of
                glasses. Bifocal lenses have two prescriptions or powers within
                the one lens. They are designed to help people who have trouble
                seeing at two different distances. Each prescription is
                separated by a visible line, so the wearer can know where to
                look for each distance.

            What is the difference between single vision lenses and multifocal
            (progressive) lenses?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Multifocal lenses, which may also be referred to as progressive
            lenses, have multiple powers or prescriptions over the one lens
            surface. This means the wearer can see near, intermediate and far
            distances all in the one lens. However, unlike bifocals, these
            lenses do not have a visible line separating each power or
            prescription, so the transition from one to another is blended. Read

          <h2>The lens index</h2>
          <p>
            When talking about lens types, you may often come across the phrase
            lens index. The lens index is a group of values that refers to how
            well a lens can refract light. The higher the index, the thinner and
            lighter the lens will be.
            <br /><br />
            Single vision lenses can come in several different indexes.
            Generally, the stronger a prescription, the thicker and heavier the
            lens. The thickness and weight can be reduced by choosing a higher
            index lens. At Oscar Wylee we provide several indexes for your
            lenses including:

              <h3>1.5 Index Lens</h3>
              <p>
                The 1.5 lens is the standard lens thickness for glasses at Oscar
                Wylee. This lens is suitable for those with a mild prescription.
              </p>

              <h3>1.6 Mid Index Lens</h3>
              <p>
                The 1.6 lenses are about 35% thinner than the 1.5 lens and are
                for people with moderate to stronger prescriptions.

            <div class="flexText">
              <h3>1.67 Index Lens</h3>
              <p>
                These lenses are ideal for those with stronger prescription
                needs. They are around 50% thinner than the standard 1.5 lens.
              </p>

              <h3>1.74 Index Lens</h3>
              <p>
                This is the thinnest lens we offer here at Oscar Wylee. It is
                about 60% thinner than a 1.5 lens and is recommended for strong
                prescriptions.
