              <p>
                It is recommended that you check your eyes every 2 years, even
                if you have not noticed any changes in your vision. This is
                because very early changes in your eye health may not lead to
                any changes in your eyesight, and may only be detected through
                an eye test. You may also be suffering from undetected eye
                strain and vision problems.
                <br /><br />
                If you have noticed any changes in your vision, or have medical
                conditions like diabetes, or are at risk of eye conditions like
                glaucoma or macular degeneration, a more frequent eye
                examination may be recommended by your optometrist.

            optical correction that requires a private party’s involvement is
            not included as part of Medicare’s coverage.

            The cost of an eye test varies depending on the purpose of the eye
            test. Initial comprehensive eye examination is $60. Please check
            with our staff for further details.
