          <h1>How to Read Your Eye Prescription</h1>
          <p>
            An eyeglasses prescription is provided by your optometrist after a
            routine eye test and has information about the type of glasses you
            need and the strength of prescription for your lenses.
            <br /><br />
            Read on to find out more about how to read a glasses prescription
            and when you should update yours.

          <h2>What is an eyeglasses prescription?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            If you need glasses, a prescription will specify the exact strength
            which is needed to correct your vision.
            <br /><br />
            Because your prescription is more than just the correction for near
            or farsightedness, you shouldn’t share your glasses with another
            person, even if you think you have the same prescription.

          <h2>How do I find out my glasses prescription?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            An eye prescription for glasses is provided by an optometrist once
            they have completed your eye test. But you will only receive a
            prescription if your vision needs correcting.
            <br /><br />
            This glasses prescription is then handed over to the optical
            dispenser so that they can help you pick the most suitable glasses
            for your needs and prescription.

            A spectacles prescription chart can look very confusing for someone
            who doesn’t work in the eye care field, as it is filled with
            abbreviations and different numbers and symbols.
            <br /><br />
            Below is an explanation of the different numbers and abbreviations

            20/20 vision is used as a way of quantifying normal vision. It is a
            term that represents your visual acuity and is based on letter
            charts you see at the optometrist. If you have 20/20 vision, you
            would most likely not need a prescription, unless you have other
            issues such as astigmatism or a vision condition.

              <p>
                The prescription you receive from your optometrist for glasses
                will include an expiration date. A spectacles prescription is
                usually valid for 1-2 years depending on contributing factors
                such as age and existing eye conditions.

            Can I use an expired glasses prescription?
          </h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            No. You should not use an expired glasses prescription as your
            vision may have deteriorated over time, leaving you with an
            inaccurate prescription requiring a new one. Wearing glasses with an
            outdated prescription can cause headaches, eye strain and blurry
            vision.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, we do not accept expired prescriptions but you can
            easily get a new prescription for your glasses by booking an eye
            test with one of our friendly optometrists.

          <h2>How often does eyeglasses prescription change?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            How often your glasses prescription changes can vary from person to
            person. For some, it may be every year, for others, it may be
            longer.
            <br /><br />
            Some factors that contribute to the rate at which your glasses prescription changes include:
          </p>

          <ul style="padding-bottom: 0">
            <li>
              <strong>Presbyopia</strong> - An age-related eye condition that
              affects near vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Astigmatism</strong> - Common condition that causes blurry
              vision, eye strain and headaches that can change over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cataracts</strong> - Age-related changes in the lens of
              the eye, leading to a decline in clear vision.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Or, if you notice any significant or sudden change in your eyesight,
            seek care from an eye care professional immediately.

          <p class="minusPadding">
            We recommend that you get a regular eye test every two years and
            annually if you are over the age of 65. An optometrist will test
            your vision to see if you need an updated glasses prescription.
