            Whether it’s the school blackboard or the playground, your child
            today relies heavily on visual information and the ability to see
            clearly. According to The Journal of Behavioural Optometry, 80% of
            young children's learning comes from sight.
            <br /><br />
            Despite this, many Australian children are suffering from an
            undetected vision problem. These eye conditions can cause slow
            development, physical distress, behavioural issues and can stop your
            child from reaching their full potential.

          <h2>What is a children's optometrist?</h2>
          <p>
            TThere are three types of eye care professionals: an optometrist, an
            optical dispenser and an ophthalmologist. In the
            <a

            nor is there a qualification that is specifically called a

            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/eye-care/optometrist"

            will check if there's a family history of poor vision. <br /><br />
            Then they will perform a comprehensive vision assessment. This
            includes checking how one eye sees compared to the other. They will
            test eye teaming, distance vision, ocular eye movements and look for
            signs of lazy eye, short sightedness and long sightedness.
            <br /><br />
            Finally, a digital image may be taken of your child’s eyes and
            visual system. They will consult you on any issues. A follow-up test
            may be made as well.
            <br /><br />
            If there is anything of particular concern found during the process
            of a test, an optometrist may refer you and your child to a
            paediatric ophthalmologist, a health professional with more
            specialty in children’s eye problems.

            they can have a very permanent and negative effect on quality of
            life. Not only will it harm your child’s hand-eye coordination, but
            children’s vision problems can also cause social or mental distress
            in daily life.

          <h2>What to do before going to an optometrist</h2>
          <p>
            Make an appointment time that suits your child, a time where they’ll
            be most cooperative. The exam itself will probably only take 20
            minutes. It’s best to arrive early to sort out the paperwork. If
            possible, have your child's preferred toys or books with you as
            well.
          </p>

          <h3>Your Medicare Cover</h3>
          <p>
            Remember to have your Medicare card with you. At Oscar Wylee, our
            optometrists offer bulk billed eye examinations to any eligible card
            holder. Parents should also have any questions ready before the
            appointment.

          <h2>How to manage children's vision problems</h2>
          <p>
            If they find your child has vision issues, they will issue a
            corrective prescription. This means your child may need contact
            lenses or glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>For any health funds members</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a member of a health fund, be sure to bring your
            membership card. You could purchase any prescription glasses or
            prescription sunglasses your child may need with full optical
            coverage depending on your policy.
          </p>

          <h2 class="addTopMargin">How can I improve my child's vision?</h2>
          <p>
            During the eye examination, your optometrist may prescribe various
            eye exercises to help your child develop the necessary visual skills
            to navigate their natural environment. These may include eye
            movement exercises or other forms of vision therapy. Make sure your
            child is performing these eye exercises and help them understand why
            they need to do them. Your optometrist may also suggest some habits
            for your child to help with myopia control and good visual hygiene.
          </p>

          <h3>Tips for parents</h3>
          <p>
            Playing with your children can also help their visual perception.
            Games like throwing and catching a ball, solving puzzles, reading to
            them out loud or playing memory games will develop your child’s
            ability to see and develop good vision.
