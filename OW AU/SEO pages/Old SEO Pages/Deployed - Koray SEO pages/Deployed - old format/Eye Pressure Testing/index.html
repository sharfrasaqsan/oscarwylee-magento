          <p>
            Eye pressure, also known as intraocular pressure (IOP), is an
            important aspect of overall eye health and can be used to detect eye
            conditions and diseases.
            <br /><br />
            Read on to find out more about how your eye pressure is measured and
            when you should get yours tested.

          <h2>What is an eye pressure test?</h2>
          <p>
            An eye pressure test is performed by an optometrist or a trained
            optical dispenser, commonly using an NCT (non-contact tonometer). It
            is a part of the pretesting routine and is used to determine the
            health of your eye.

                Increased pressure occurs in the eye when a fluid called aqueous
                humor does not drain properly. Rising pressure in the eyes can
                potentially damage your optic nerve and cause glaucoma.

          <h2>How is an eye pressure test performed?</h2>
          <p>
            There are multiple tests eye care professionals use to measure eye
            pressure depending on the patient's needs or the equipment they
            have. Below are the three main types of eye pressure tests.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-Contact Tonometry</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            At Oscar Wylee, our qualified optometrists use the NCT method to
            test your intraocular eye pressure which is the internal pressure of
            the eye. It is part of the pretesting routine and is built into the
            autorefractor.
            <br /><br />
            Non-contact tonometry, also known as air puff tonometry, uses a
            rapid air pulse that flattens your cornea. The time when your eye
            becomes flat is how the pressure is measured, which is derived from
            the monitored reflection of an incident infrared light.
          </p>

          <span class="smallText">Source: National Library of Medicine</span>

          <h3 class="addTopMargin">Applanation Tonometry</h3>
          <p>
            In the applanation tonometry procedure, the eyes are numbed using
            drops with dye in them and your head will be positioned on a slit
            lamp, a diagnostic tool used in ocular examinations. The eye
            pressure is measured using a small tip that gently touches the
            surface of the eye.
          </p>

          <h3>Rebound Tonometry</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            This test uses a small, plastic-tipped probe to test the pressure of
            your eye. The probe bounces gently against the cornea without the
            need for numbing eye drops. Rebound Tonometry is often used for
            children or for patients who are unable to have more traditional eye
            pressure tests performed.

          <h2>What does an eye pressure test measure?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            As the name suggests, an eye pressure test measures the pressure in
            your eye as a result of fluid buildup and is used to evaluate your
            eye health. Eye pressure can find signs of optic nerve damage and
            glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can cause blindness.

          <h2>Does an eye pressure test hurt your eye?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            An eye pressure test is not harmful to your eyes. If your
            optometrist is using the NCT method, it will be tested using a puff
            of air which may feel odd but is not painful. Numbing eye drops will
            also be applied for certain tests to ensure there is no discomfort.

          <p>
            At Oscar Wylee, our optometrists or optical dispensers will perform
            an eye pressure test. An ophthalmologist can also perform eye
            pressure tests.

          <h2 class="topMargin">What is the normal range for eye pressure?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            While everyoneâ€™s eye pressure is different there is a general range
            that they fall into. The normal span of eye pressure is between 10
            and 21 mmHg (millimetres of mercury).

            If you have slightly high eye pressure, you are not likely to notice
            any symptoms, but if the pressure is very high you may experience
            nausea, vomiting or pain in and around the eye.
