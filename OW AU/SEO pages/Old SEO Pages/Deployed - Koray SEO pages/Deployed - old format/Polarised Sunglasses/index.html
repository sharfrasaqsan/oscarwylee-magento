          <h2>What are polarised sunglasses?</h2>
          <p>
            At Oscar Wylee, polarised sunglasses are like normal sunglasses: a
            frame for protecting your eyes from the sun. Except these sunglasses
            use polarised lenses, which have a coating applied that gives a
            shield against UV rays and reduces glare, allowing you to see with
            full contrast and detail.
          </p>

          <h3>Polarised vs. non-polarised sunglasses</h3>
          <p>
            Non-polarised sunglasses are effective at shielding your eyes from
            UV rays and UV rays alone. Polarised lenses don’t just offer UV
            protection, they also filter out reflected light and surface glare
            for greater clarity.

          <h2>How do polarised lenses work?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Polarised lenses work by filtering out half of the wavelength of
            light that reaches the glasses. This half that was filtered away,
            the horizontal wave of light, is the half that contained glare,
            reflections, and intense brightness. As the glasses have now blocked
            this layer of light, you can now see clearer and glares cannot reach
            your eyes.
            <br /><br />
            This effect is achieved by how the lenses are created, and by how
            the tint applies to the glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>Creating polarised lenses</h3>

          <div class="flexContainer">
            <div class="flexText" style="margin-left: -0.5rem">
              <p class="minusPadding">
                Polarised lenses are made most commonly by taking a soft PVA
                material that is heated and stretched to form a long chain
                molecule. This long chain molecule is vertically aligned along
                the lense in one direction, like blinds on a window. This sheet
                is then laminated between 2 high quality lenses using an
                injection mold.
                <br /><br />
                The ‘window blinds’ make it so that only polarised vertical
                light may reach your eyes. This method is especially common for
                Oakley products and other brands, according to Dave Barton.
                <br /><br />
                A common misconception about polarised sunglasses is that there
                is a ‘special chemical’ involved in the creation. This chemical
                is called silver halide, and it is used in transition lenses,
                not polarisation.

          <h2>How to tell if your sunglasses are polarised</h2>
          <p>
            If you don’t know if your sunnies are polarised, take them off,
            rotate them 90 degrees and put them in front of your computer or
            phone screen. If the screen darkens, changes colour or disappears
            completely, then you have polarised sunglasses.
          </p>

          <h3>Alternative test for polarised lenses</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            If you have 2 pairs of polarised sunglasses, you can perform an even
            more accurate test. Hold one pair of glasses in front of the other,
            then rotate one 90 degrees. If the lens darkens or turns black, the
            lens is polarised.
          </p>

          <h2 class="addTopMargin">When to use polarised sunglasses</h2>
          <p>
            These quality sunnies are perfectly versatile, a great fit for
            sports, driving, or other outdoor occasions. The high protection
            against glare means that with your sunglasses you can look at a body
            of water and see right through the glare on the surface, making them
            world class eyewear for fishing trips!
          </p>

          <h3>Polarised lenses and UV blocking</h3>
          <p>
            Although it’s easy to get them confused, polarisation and UV
            blocking are not the same thing. Polarised lenses are a type of
            glass with filters that only let in a certain type of light. Your
            favourite brands UV blocking glasses are simply made of a material
            or have a coating applied that blocks UV rays.

          <h2>How to clean polarised sunglasses</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            No matter what cleaning method you use, be very careful not to
            scratch or damage the lenses. You can clean your sunglasses with
            water and a mild detergent, a gentle soap or rubbing alcohol and a
            clean, gentle cloth. If any of these cleaning products are too
            strong, your polarised sunglasses may start showing signs of wear
            and tear much earlier.

          <h3>Will water damage my polarised lenses?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            According to Safety gear pro, water will not typically damage your
            sunnies. However, if they are submerged for a long time, they will
            eventually be affected. This damage will happen faster with salt or
            chlorine water.
          </p>

          <span class="smallText">Source: Safety Gear Pro</span>

          <h3>Are polarised sunglasses worth it?</h3>
          <p>
            UV rays are a leading cause of eye issues. According to Health
            Engine, damage caused by sun glare can range from mild irritation
            and cataracts, to more severe conditions such as eye cancer or
            growth on the eyelids.
