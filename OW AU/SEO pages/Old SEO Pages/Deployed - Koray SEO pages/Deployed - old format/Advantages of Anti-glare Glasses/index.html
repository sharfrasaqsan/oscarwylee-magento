          <h1>The Advantages Of Anti-glare Glasses</h1>
          <p>
            One of the drawbacks of any corrective prescription or even a normal
            pair of sunglasses is reflection from the lens surface. With
            Anti-glare glasses, you can see and be seen clearer than ever
            before.
          </p>

          <h2>How do anti-glare glasses work?</h2>
          <p>
            Anti-glare glasses are glasses that have had a coating applied to
            the lens. This coating is composed of many thin layers of materials
            with an alternating refraction index. These materials even out the
            refraction of light, reducing reflection, allowing over 99% more
            light to pass through the lens.
            <br /><br />
            Oscar Wylee applies anti-glare coating via vacuum. This means that
            there will be no spray marks or uneven surfaces along your glasses.
            We can add this coating to many different types of lens, such as
            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/guides/lenses/bifocal.html"
              class="linkTo"
              >bifocal</a
            >
            or progressive lenses. <br /><br />
            The lens coating also has a ‘bloom’ colour. This is a faint,
            lingering colour from the coating itself. The colour itself is most
            commonly green, but blue or purple coating can be found as well.
          </p>

          <h3>Why is reflection a problem?</h3>
          <p>
            When any source of light reaches your spectacles, it strikes the
            back of your lenses and reflects. The reflection from the front of
            the lens will prevent others from seeing your eyes and the
            reflection from the back of the lens will be seen by you. This is
            the reason you may sometimes see your own eyes reflected in a pair
            of uncoated glasses, and it’s one of the best reasons to use
            anti-glare coating on your glasses.

          <h2>What are the advantages of anti-glare glasses?</h2>
          <p>
            Having an anti-glare coating on your glasses will reduce the glare
            you receive from light and reflective light. This will reduce eye
            strain, increase vision, and prevent disruptful reflections.
            <br /><br />
            Because of the hardening material used in the coating, anti-glare
            frames also have scratch-resistant features. The coating can also
            make you appear better. With the glare reduction, your facial
            features will be clearer for all to see.
            <br /><br />
            The glare blocking will also enhance your frames appearance as it
            will reduce distracting reflections and make you and your glasses
            look better in photographs due to reducing the effects of flash.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I stop glare when I’m driving?</h3>
          <p>
            Anti-glare glasses do not reduce the amount of light that reaches
            your eyes. In fact, anti-glare coating can improve your night vision
            when you wear it because more light can reach your eyes with no
            glare blocking your vision.
            <br /><br />
            This makes them a recomended choice for a night drive, for leisure
            or professional work.

          <h2>Anti-glare glasses for computer:</h2>
          <p>
            By preventing the bright reflections and glares of both natural and
            artificial light, anti-glare glasses can provide a greater degree of
            comfort when you are working with computers.
            <br /><br />
            One of the greatest benefits of anti-glare is when video
            conferencing. The person viewing your camera image will be able to
            see through to your eyes without the harsh reflection of your
            computer screen obstructing their view.

                Are anti-glare and blue light glasses the same?
              </h3>
              <p class="minusPadding">
                Blue light is believed to be a sleep disrupting light that emits
                from many everyday sources of artificial light, such as computer
                screens or cell phones.
                <br /><br />
                Blue light lenses and anti-glare lenses both reduce the amount
                of glare that reaches your eyes from all sources of light.
                However, blue light glasses may be able to block high energy
                lights from artificial sources that may cause discomfort.
                <br /><br />
                Anti-glare glasses are more general in their purpose and are
                made to reduce disruptive reflections and allow more forms of
                light through your lenses. This includes the high-energy rays
                emitted by digital screens.
                <br /><br />
                Anti-glare coating will not prevent the possible neurological
                effects in the way that adult or children’s blue light glasses
                may be able to.
                <br /><br />
                At Oscar Wylee, our blue light filter options also include
                anti-glare technology.

          <h2>Disadvantages of anti-glare glasses:</h2>
          <p>
            As anti-glare coatings reduce glare and provide enhanced clarity,
            any fingerprints or dust on the lens surface will appear to be more
            visible. It is common for people to mention that it is harder to
            keep their anti-reflective lenses clean.
            <br /><br />
            Because of the enhanced clarity the frames provide, the lenses will
            always be more clear to see. As a result, they will stain with
            fingerprints and oil smudges more often and more visibly, as well as
            scratches and damage being more clear in the lenses.
            <br /><br />
            The coating is also applied to the outside of the lens. This means
            extreme temperatures may affect your glasses faster than an uncoated
            pair.
          </p>

          <h3>Cleaning and keeping anti-glare glasses</h3>
          <p>
            As the coating applied to your lenses makes smudges more visible,
            caution is advised in cleaning your new glasses. Using a microfiber
            cloth is highly recommended, as any other fabric may damage or
            remove the coating. It’s also recommended to use a spray lens
            cleaner which will help to lift dust and dirt without scratching the
            lens.
            <br /><br />
            Your glasses should be stored in its protective casing when not in
            use, to minimise accidental damage to the frame, lenses or coating.
