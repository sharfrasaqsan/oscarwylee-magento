      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Cataracts:</span>
          Cataracts are an age-related eye condition that affects a person’s
          lens. Due to a disruption to the lens, it limits the amount of light
          that can enter the eye, causing night blindness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Glaucoma:</span>
          Glaucoma is a term for a group of eye conditions that causes damage to
          the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss. According to Glaucoma
          Australia, people with glaucoma can experience impaired dark
          adaptation which can affect a person’s ability to drive safely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Myopia:</span>
          Myopia is a refractive error that causes a person’s distance vision to
          be blurry. This eye condition may cause a person’s night vision to be
          blurry as if their vision is affected in daylight, it is likely to
          worsen in low light.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Diabetes:</span>
          Diabetes is characterised by uncontrolled blood sugar levels and can
          lead to the eye condition diabetic retinopathy which may cause
          symptoms such as poor night vision.

            Kierstan Boyd in 2016, night blindness is not the inability to see
            at night, rather it means your vision is worse when it is dark.

            An article that was updated in 2022 in the National Library of

            H. Le, discusses night blindness on a cellular level and also
            explains the development, mechanism and clinical significance, among
            other areas of night blindness.

            Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is important for normal
            eyesight function. According to the World Health Organisation, night
            blindness is one of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency. Foods
            containing vitamin A include carrots, pumpkin, sweet potato, eggs
            and fortified milk.

            published in the National Library of Medicine, a person with a zinc
            deficiency may develop night blindness. There are many foods that
            contain zinc including fish, poultry, meat and dairy.

            <span class="list-title">Pre-testing:</span>
            Pre-testing occurs before the main testing with an optometrist and
            is typically performed by an optical dispenser or a trained staff
            member. This test will involve an eye pressure test, also known as a
            tonometry test, which will assess intraocular eye pressure. A
            digital photograph may also be taken of your eye to assess any
            changes in the eye.

            <span class="list-title">Slit lamp test:</span>
            A slit lamp test will assess your eye health and examine the
            anterior and posterior of the eye which includes your cornea and
            iris.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Visual acuity test:</span>
            A visual acuity test measures the clarity and sharpness of a
            person's vision using a letter chart. The results for this test will
            be denoted using a fraction such as 20/20 which is the measurement
            of normal vision.
