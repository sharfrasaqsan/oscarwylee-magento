        Reading and understanding an eyeglasses prescription can be difficult
        for those unfamiliar with the optometry profession and the scientific
        terms they use. Some of the terms and abbreviations you may encounter on
        a glasses prescription include PD (pupillary distance), cylinder (CYL),
        sphere (SPH), axis, add and prism. Cylinder in an eye prescription
        refers to the amount of astigmatism a person has. Another pair of
        abbreviations include OD and OS which refer to the right and left eye
        respectively. These are Latin abbreviations used in a glasses
        prescription in certain countries although in Australia, we typically
        refer to them as the right and left eye. An eye prescription chart is a
        piece of paper or digital copy that holds information about a patient’s
        vision.
        <br /><br />
        An eyeglasses prescription represents a person’s vision and what is
        required to correct their eyesight. The purpose of a prescription is to
        provide the patient with clear and comfortable vision by supplying the
        correctly powered lenses. Generally, you won’t need to know how to read
        a prescription for glasses, as this is the role of the optometrist and
        optical dispenser.
        <br /><br />
        Four ways to help a person read an eye prescription are familiarising
        yourself with eye prescription abbreviations, identifying the right and
        left eye on the prescription, understanding the eye prescription scale
        or range and looking out for additional eye prescription values. The
        ways to read an eyeglasses prescription are listed below.

        1. Familiarise Yourself With Eye Prescription Abbreviations
      </h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Familiarise yourself with the eye prescription abbreviations to
        understand what your eyes require to see comfortably and clearly. The
        common eye prescription abbreviations include SPH, CYL and PD and they
        are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">SPH (Sphere):</span>
          SPH is an abbreviation for sphere. On a glasses prescription, SPH
          indicates the amount of nearsightedness and/or farsightedness a
          patient has, which is written as a number showing the lens power
          measured in diopters. Sphere is denoted with a plus (+) symbol for
          farsightedness and a minus (-) symbol for nearsightedness. These plus
          or minus numbers will determine the power of the lens needed to
          correct a patient’s vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">CYL (Cylinder):</span>
          CYL is an abbreviation for cylinder and on an eyeglasses prescription
          it represents the amount of astigmatism a patient has and is denoted
          with a minus (-) symbol. Astigmatism is corrected using a CYL lens
          which is equal but opposite to the amount of astigmatism that is on
          the prescription.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">PD (Pupillary Distance):</span>
          PD is an abbreviation for pupillary distance and is the measurement in
          millimetres of the distance between a person’s eyes. It is used to
          ensure that your lenses are positioned properly to give you clear
          vision. At Oscar Wylee, a patient’s PD is not shown on their
          prescription, rather it is measured after their eye test by one of our
          retail staff.

        prescription by clearly noting it as Right Eye and Left Eye. However, in
        other countries like the US and Canada, they use OD and OS. According to
        the American Academy of Ophthalmology, these abbreviations are derived
        from Latin with OD standing for oculus dexter, which is the right eye,
        and OS standing for oculus sinister, which is the left eye.

        There are additional eye prescription values that you may be unaware of
        their meaning. Other eye prescription values include axis, add, int add
        and prism, which are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Axis:</span>
          Axis is a number between 0-180 degrees which specifies the angle to
          correct astigmatism. Axis and CYL cannot occur without the other as
          they work together to correct astigmatism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Add:</span>
          Add, an abbreviation of addition, represents the amount of
          magnification required for near vision which is denoted with a plus
          (+) symbol. Add may be needed for reading glasses, bifocals, and
          multifocals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Int Add:</span>
          Similarly to add, int add stands for intermediate addition which is
          the magnification needed for intermediate vision such as computer
          vision. Int add is approximately 70 cm away and is used in multifocal
          lenses as it is the prescription between near and distance vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Prism:</span>
          Prism correction can be added to a patient's lenses if they experience
          double vision or have trouble focusing.

      <p class="para-content">
        An eyeglasses prescription is the amount of correction your vision
        requires in order to see clearly and comfortably. An eye prescription
        will be acquired through an eye test performed by an optometrist who
        will assess a patient’s vision to determine if they need vision
        correction and if they do, the type and power. For example, someone with
        farsightedness will need prescription glasses to make their near
        distance clear and vice versa for nearsightedness. There are also
        refractive errors such as astigmatism or presbyopia that can affect a
        person’s vision which will be noted on their prescription.
        <br /><br />
        Once a person receives their prescription, the optometrist will hand it
        over to an optical dispenser who can help the patient find the right
        pair of lenses for their prescription needs. This could mean purchasing
        a pair of reading glasses or multifocal lenses.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">How Does an Eyeglasses Prescription Work?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          An eyeglasses prescription works by noting the amount of correction a
          patient’s vision needs using numbered values with either a plus or
          minus. There is also a number in degrees that notes the degree of axis
          needed to correct astigmatism. A glasses prescription will be handed
          over from the optometrist to an optical dispenser to interpret and
          then find the right pair of lenses for the patient. The ultimate
          purpose of a prescription is to give the patient clear and comfortable
          sight through vision correction.

        <p class="para-content">
          An eyeglasses prescription is very important for people who need
          vision correction. A prescription specifies the exact strength needed
          to correct a person's vision and will inform what lenses should be put
          into their glasses. Without a prescription, you will not be able to
          purchase a pair of optical glasses that will give you clear and
          comfortable vision.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What is a Normal Eyeglasses Prescription?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        There is no such thing as a normal eyeglasses prescription as each
        person requires a prescription based on their own eyesight and eye
        health needs. However, in terms of visual acuity, which measures the
        sharpness and clarity of a person’s vision, 20/20 vision is used as a
        way to quantify normal vision. If a person has 20/20 vision, it means
        they can see an object clearly twenty feet away or 6 metres. This
        measurement is determined by reading letters on an eye chart, commonly a
        Snellen chart.
        <br /><br />
        While 20/20 vision is considered normal, people can have better visual
        acuity. For example, a person could have 20/15 vision which means they
        can see clearly at 20 feet what a person with 20/20 vision would need to
        be 15 feet away to see. A person with 20/20 vision will most likely not
        need corrective lenses although they may require an eye prescription if
        there are other visual issues such as astigmatism.

          What Does +1.25 Mean on Eyeglasses Prescription?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          The value +1.25 diopters on an eyeglasses prescription means the
          patient has a minor level of farsightedness, meaning they may
          experience blurriness in their near vision when reading or doing other
          close-up tasks. A sphere of +1.25 diopters can be corrected with
          prescription glasses that can be provided by an optometrist.

          What is the Eyeglasses Prescription for Nearsightedness?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          An eyeglasses prescription for nearsightedness will have a sphere
          (SPH) value denoted with a minus (-) symbol meaning the eye
          prescription requires a minus-powered lens. According to the American
          Academy of Ophthalmology, mild nearsightedness lens prescription is
          typically 3.00 diopters and below, moderate is 3.00-6.00 diopters and
          severe nearsightedness is 6.00 diopters and above.
          <br /><br />
          Nearsightedness, known scientifically as myopia, is a refractive error
          that affects distance vision due to an overly curved cornea or an
          elongated eyeball. A person with nearsightedness will have eyes that
          are not capable of bending and focusing light on the retina correctly.
          The lenses used to correct nearsightedness are concave lenses which
          correct the focal issues and give the wearer clear and comfortable
          vision. Wearing eyeglasses will not cure nearsightedness, rather they
          will correct the vision issue through a prescription lens.

          What is the Eyeglasses Prescription for Farsightedness?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          An eyeglasses prescription for farsightedness will have a sphere (SPH)
          value denoted with a plus (+) symbol meaning the eye prescription
          requires a plus-powered lens. The lenses that correct farsightedness
          are called convex lenses or plus lenses. Convex lenses are
          characterised by their thick centre that helps light focus back onto
          the retina. According to Central Oregon Eye Care, the prescription for
          mild farsightedness is +2.00 diopter or less and +6.00 diopter and
          over is considered an extreme farsightedness prescription.
          <br /><br />
          Farsightedness, known scientifically as hyperopia, is a refractive
          error that occurs when light does not reflect within the eye
          correctly, making it difficult for the eyes to clearly and sharply see
          objects at near distances. Symptoms of farsightedness include blurry
          near vision, eye strain and headaches. Farsightedness cannot be cured
          with prescription lenses, rather it is corrected which means the
          lenses help direct the light that enters the eye onto the retina.

          What is the Eyeglasses Prescription for Astigmatism?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          On an eyeglasses prescription, CYL (cylinder) represents the amount of
          astigmatism which is denoted with a minus (-) symbol. According to
          Vision Centre, mild astigmatism is 1.00 diopter and below, moderate is
          1.00-2.00 diopter, severe is 2.00-3.00 diopter and extreme is 3.00
          diopter and above. Astigmatism is corrected using a CYL lens which is
          equal but opposite to the amount of astigmatism that is represented on
          the patient’s prescription.
          <br /><br />
          Astigmatism is a type of refractive error that occurs when the cornea
          or lens on a person's eye is deformed or misshapen which disrupts the
          eye’s ability to focus light onto the retina. Uncorrected astigmatism
          can cause blurry vision, poor night vision and headaches. It is
          possible to have astigmatism and other refraction errors, such as
          myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) at the same
          time.

        The duration that a glasses prescription is valid for is typically 1-2
        years. The expiry for a prescription can vary from person to person due
        to contributing factors such as existing eye conditions and age. For
        example, an older person may have a shorter expiration on their
        prescription as their vision is more likely to decline as they age. To

        <p class="para-content">
          A person should update their glasses prescription when it expires. At
          Oscar Wylee, we recommend everyone should have an eye test at least
          once every two years. For those over the age of 65, a yearly review is
          advised. Having a regular eye test allows an optometrist to monitor
          any changes in your vision which may require an updated prescription.
          They can also monitor the progression of eye conditions you may have.
          <br /><br />
          While having an eye test at least once every two years is a good
          schedule to follow, there are other signs that may indicate you need a
          new glasses prescription. These signs include vision changes such as
          blurry or double vision, difficulty focusing, squinting, eye strain
          when wearing glasses, not having regular eye tests and poor night
          vision.

          How Often Does an Eyeglasses Prescription Change?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          There is no definitive answer for how often an eyeglasses prescription
          changes as it can vary from person to person. For some it could be
          years, for others, it may be longer or even less. There are certain
          factors that can impact how quickly a prescription can change
          including age as there are many age-related eye conditions that cause
          a person’s eyesight to decline. This includes presbyopia which affects
          near vision and cataracts which occur due to age-related changes in
          the lens. Existing refractive errors may also be a factor such as
          astigmatism which causes blurry vision due to the irregular shape of
          the eyeball.
          <br /><br />
          If you have noticed any significant changes in your vision, book an
          eye test with an optometrist.

            Can Wearing Lower Prescription Glasses Damage the Eyes?
          </h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            No, wearing lower prescription glasses will not damage the eyes,
            although it is not recommended as it could cause eye strain and
            discomfort. People should also refrain from wearing other people's
            glasses even if they think they have the same prescription. This is
            because a prescription is more than simply the correction for near
            or farsightedness, it could also contain correction for astigmatism
            or even a prism lens. If you think your glasses prescription is too
            low or you are having trouble with your lenses, come and visit an
            Oscar Wylee near you where we can help update your prescription and
            glasses if needed.

            Can I Use an Expired Glasses Prescription to Buy New Glasses?
          </h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            No, you cannot use an expired glasses prescription to buy new
            glasses as they will not be accepted by the optometrist or retail
            staff. If you need a new pair of glasses, you will be required to
            have your eyes tested to receive a new prescription. An expiration
            date on a prescription ensures you have your eye’s regularly tested
            as it is common for vision to deteriorate over time.
            <br /><br />
            Wearing glasses that have an outdated prescription can cause eye
            discomfort such as eye strain and headaches and may also cause
            blurry vision if the prescription is no longer strong enough to
            correct your vision. We do not accept expired prescriptions at Oscar
            Wylee, but you can easily book an eye test appointment in-store with
            one of our friendly optometrists to receive an updated prescription
            that you can use to either update your lenses or order a new pair of
            glasses.
