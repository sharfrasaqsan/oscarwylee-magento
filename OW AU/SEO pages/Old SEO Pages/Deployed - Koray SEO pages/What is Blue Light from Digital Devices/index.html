            What is Blue Light from Digital Devices? Is it Harmful for Eyes?
          </h1>
          <h2>What is Blue Light?</h2>
          <p>
            Blue light is a HEV (High-Energy Visible) light, similar to
            ultraviolet rays, both created by the sun. There are also artificial
            sources of blue light such as tablets and smartphone screens. Blue
            light is a high energy light source that is measured in nanometres
            (nm). Blue light wavelengths measure between 380 to 500 nanometers,
            according to UC Davis Health.
            <br /><br />
            Blue light is unique because the eyes cannot filter it as
            effectively as other colours of light, meaning more blue light
            reaches the eyes than any other light on the spectrum. It has been
            theorised that blue light, especially from digital devices, may
            negatively affect the eyes by disrupting sleep cycles and causing
            eye fatigue, eye strain and ocular migraines. People may be able to
            limit the effects of extended blue light exposure by resting the
            eyes, wearing blue light glasses or by finding anti-blue light
            settings, products and apps for computers, phones and televisions.

              <h2>Where Does Blue Light Come From?</h2>

              <p>
                Blue light comes from natural sunlight and artificial sources of
                light, such as smartphones, tablets, LED screens and computer
                screens. There are two main sources of bluelight, these are
                natural and unnatural sources. The natural sources of bluelight
                are mainly the sun, and its light. Sunlight is a constant in
                everyday life and causes the body to feel awake, energetic and
                functional. Blue light in smartphones and tablets has the same
                amount of wavelengths and comes from the LED lights used to make
                the screens.

          <h3>What are the High-Energy Blue Light Sources?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The high-energy blue light sources are the sun and technology such
            as smartphones, tablets, LED screens, computers, laptops and gaming
            systems. The sources of high-energy blue light are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Smartphones:</b> Smartphones are mobile phones that have many
              of the same functions as computers, such as internet browsing.
              Smartphones may have between 400 and 490 nm of blue light.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tablets:</b> A tablet is a digital device that operates like a
              computer, only wireless. A tablet may have between 400 - 490 nm of
              blue light emitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Computers:</b> Computers are digital devices for internet
              browsing, data storage and processing. Computers are a big source
              of blue light for many people.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Laptops:</b> Laptops are portable computers that may emit
              between 400 and 490 nm of blue light.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Gaming Consoles:</b> Gaming consoles are screens that people
              use to play video games on. There may be between 400 - 490 nm of
              blue light in a gaming console.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>LED screens:</b> Other LED screens, such as digital billboards
              and posters are a source of blue light.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What are the Natural Sources of Blue Light?</h3>
          <p>
            The sun is the only source of natural blue light. Any other natural
            source of blue light is a product or extension of the sun's blue
            light rays. This includes glares or reflections.
          </p>

          <h3 class="addTopMargin">
            What is the Difference Between High-energy and Natural Sources of
            Blue Light for Human eye?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There is no major difference between high-energy and natural sources
            of blue light. Blue light always affects the eyes the same way,
            regardless of the source or intensity of the light source itself.
            The only minor difference between high-energy and natural sources of
            blue light is the time of day the body is likely to experience them.
            Blue light from the sun is only experienced during the day, when it
            has been shown to have positive effects on the body, such as an
            elevation in mood and greater work productivity. Blue light can
            disrupt their sleeping patterns if a person is on their phone or
            their computer later in the day or at night time, as blue llight
            helps to regulate sleep.

              <h2>What is the Blue Light Wavelength?</h2>
              <p>
                The blue light wavelength ranges between 380 to 500 nm. Light
                wavelengths are the microscopic but perceivable particles that
                make up colours and light, known as photons. The light spectrum
                reaches the maximum wavelength at 700 nm, the wavelength of red
                light. Blue light wavelength is similar to the ultraviolet rays
                the sun creates on a daily basis, in that it is a small
                wavelength that passes through surfaces but still emits a high
                amount of energy.

          <h3>How to Measure Wavelength of Blue Light?</h3>
          <p>
            The blue light wavelength is measured in nanometres. There is no
            conventional way to measure blue light at home without the use of
            specialised devices. Blue light levels are measured professionally
            using devices such as solarmeters, light-metres, also known as
            illuminance metres, and UPR techâ€™s handheld spectrometer. Blue light
            is measured in these devices by separating the levels of each form
            of light within the device. <br /><br />
            Blue light may start to negatively affect the human eye at a
            wavelength of 400 nm and above, according to the National Institute
            of Medicine. Blue light levels of 400 nm and above have a chance of
            penetrating the retina and eye lens while still retaining high
            energy, causing damage to the eyes that may lead to conditions such
            as cataracts and dry eyes. Blue light passing through the cornea
            also leads to less melatonin being made in the body, affecting a
            person's ability to rest.

          <h2>What are the Benefits of Blue Light for Human Eye?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The benefits of blue light for human eyes are increased awareness,
            greater memory, an improvement in mood, improved emotional state and
            enhanced reflexes. Blue light also aids the body's circadian rhythm,
            creating better sleep. The benefits of blue light for the human eye
            are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Awareness:</b> Blue light locks the creation of melatonin, the
              hormone that causes the body to feel sleepy, leading to greater
              sense of awareness and alertness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Greater memory:</b> Blue light heightens awareness and thought
              processing, including information received and the mindâ€™s ability
              to retain it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Improved mood:</b> The energy the body creates in response to
              seeing or feeling blue light also affects the mind, creating a
              better mood.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Enhanced reflexes:</b> Blue light creates a feeling of being
              awake, enhancing a person's ability to react to things at a
              greater speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Better rest:</b> Blue light can help the body regulate sleep.
              Exposure to blue light in the day indicates to the body that it
              needs to be awake. At night, the lack of blue light tells the body
              that it is time to sleep.

          <h2>What are the Effects of Blue Light on the Human Eye?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The effects of blue light on human eyes are increased awareness, eye
            fatigue and retinal damage. The effects of blue light on the human
            eyes are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Increased awareness</b> - Blue light stimulates the body in the
              same way natural sunlight does. The stimulation blue light causes
              makes the body feel awake and energised, creating creator
              awareness and alertness in the eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Eye fatigue</b> - Blue light is harder for the eye to perceive
              due to its low wavelength. To see blue light, the eyes increase
              the level of concentration for a long period at a time. This puts
              strain on the eyes, causing them to fatigue quickly, creating
              feelings of headaches, dry eyes and discomfort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Retinal damage</b> - Blue light is not naturally blocked by the
              front of the eye, resulting in the high energy light passing
              through the eyes and into the retina. This causes damage to the
              retina and may result in accelerated age related damage.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What are the Concerns About Blue Light?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The concerns about blue light are that it affects circadian rhythm,
            that it may damage the retina and that blue light may cause
            age-related macular degeneration. The concerns of blue light are as
            listed below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Blue light disrupts the body's circadian rhythm:</b> A person's
              natural sleep cycle or circadian rhythm, may be affected by blue
              light as this light simulates the effects of sunlight, which helps
              us to regulate sleep. This is of particular concern during times
              when eyes and brain should be resting such as night time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blue light damages the retina:</b> Blue light passes through
              the front of the eye and hits the retina, which may cause damage
              to the retina and accelerate vision problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blue light causes macular age-related degeneration:</b> There
              are concerns that blue light may damage the retina when the eye is
              overexposed to it. Some theorise that this damage may weaken the
              retina in ways that are normally only caused by ageing, increasing
              risk of macular degeneration.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>How Does Blue Light Affect Work Efficiency?</h3>
          <p>
            Blue light affects work efficiency by improving alertness, and
            reducing fatigue. Blue light affects work efficiency by preventing
            the body from creating melatonin, the hormone the body creates to
            put itself to sleep, according to Harvard Health. Blue light
            simulates sunlight and naturally wakes up the body when it comes
            into contact with the skin, making a person more awake and aware,
            increasing work efficiency.

              <h3>How Does Blue Light Affect Psychology?</h3>
              <p>
                Blue light affects psychology by elevating moods and enabling
                the body to create more energy, which prevents depression and
                assists in sleep when blue light is received during daylight
                hours. According to a study performed by the American Academy of
                Neurology, blue light therapy was shown to improve a patient's
                level of depression.
              </p>

              <h3>How Does Blue Light Affect Sleep?</h3>
              <p>
                Blue light affects sleep by disrupting the body's circadian
                rhythm, simulating sunlight and keeping the body awake. Too much
                blue light exposure causes the system to believe it is still in
                sunlight, and therefore it will not produce the hormone and
                bodily effects that cause restfulness and sleep.

          <h3>What are the Long-term Effects of Blue Light?</h3>
          <p>
            The long term effects of blue light have not yet been scientifically
            proven. As digital blue light in particular is a new technology, few
            studies definitely state what the long term effects are. Possible
            effects may include age-related macular degeneration, cataracts,
            digital eye strain and a disrupted sleep cycle. Blue light cannot be
            naturally blocked by the eyes, which causes greater issues if a
            person is viewing blue light for too long and too often.
          </p>

          <h3>What are the Short-term Effects of Blue Light?</h3>
          <p>
            The short term effects of blue light include increased awareness,
            dry eyes, eye fatigue and short headaches. Blue light is stimulating
            to look at, negatively affecting sleep cycles and preventing the
            eyes from blinking a healthy and consistent amount. This causes the
            eyes to dry quickly. Blue light causes increased awareness and
            focus, particularly on a specific object. <br /><br />
            Eyes become fatigued when focused for too long on a single point.
            Keeping attention on a blue light source for too long causes
            discomfort in the eyes and minor headaches. These headaches and
            retinal pains continue until the eyes have rested

          <h2>How Does Blue Light Affect Children?</h2>
          <p>
            Blue light affects children in the same way it affects adults. Blue
            light may affect a childâ€™s natural sleep cycle, which may disrupt
            the childâ€™s development and quality of life. A bad sleep cycle
            results in low energy throughout the day and a poor mental state
            until proper rest has been sought.

          <h2>How to Protect the Human Eye from Blue Light?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            To protect the human eye from blue light, try wearing blue light
            glasses, rest the eyes from blue light sources and turn on blue
            light blocking functions on applicable devices. The way to protect
            the human eye from blue light is listed below.

              <b>Blue Light Glasses:</b> Blue light glasses are effective in
              blocking blue light, reducing the phototoxicity of this light
              source by 10-20%, according to a 2017 study conducted by Tsz Wing
              Leung, Roger Wing-hong Li and Chea-su Kee.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Rest from blue light sources:</b> Limiting how much blue light
              the body is taking in reduces negative effects associated with
              prolonged blue light exposure. A common rule used to promote
              health and reduce issues with blue light energy is referred to as
              the 20-20-20 rule: After looking at an object 20 feet away for 20
              minutes, look away for 20 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Turn on blue light blocking:</b> Blue light on devices such as
              tablets or smartphones can be reduced or blocked depending on the
              device. Blue light blockers are found through the device's setting
              or through a separate, downloadable app.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What Emits Blue Light?</h3>
          <p>
            Blue light is emitted by the sun, light from artificial sources such
            as smartphones or computers, and fluorescent lights. Blue light and
            ultraviolet rays from the sun are blocked to a degree by wearing a
            pair of sunglasses when outdoors. Blue light from digital sources
            such as computers are blocked to a degree by using blue light
            filters, such as the ones found in glasses coatings or additional
            applications and settings in digital devices.
          </p>

          <h4>What are the Best Methods to Reduce Blue Light exposure?</h4>
          <p>
            The best methods to reduce blue light exposure is by resting the
            eyes from sources of blue light or using blue light blocking
            products such as blue light filters on glasses or blue light
            preventing apps and functions. Blue light exposure refers to the
            amount of blue light that enters the eye. <br /><br />
            Blue light exposure can also be prevented by taking breaks from
            looking at a source of blue light for more than 20 minutes. Blue
            light blocking on phones and other devices are found in the item's
            settings. Look for â€˜night shiftâ€™ or â€˜blue lightâ€™ settings to turn
            off blue light exposure on the device.

          <h2>What is Blue Light Spectrum?</h2>
          <p>
            The blue light spectrum is the visible blue light the human eye sees
            on the colour spectrum. The visible light spectrum is all the
            wavelengths of colour the human eye sees and perceivably measures.
            Blue lightâ€™s measurement on the scale is 400-500 nm, with red being
            at the very end of the scale at 700 nm.
            <br /><br />
            Blue light filter glasses and light spectrum glasses do not disrupt
            the wearers ability to see blue light. Blue light glasses instead
            attempt to prevent the high energy that blue light wavelengths
            contain from passing through the eyes.
