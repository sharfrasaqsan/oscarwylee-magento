      Astigmatism: Definition, Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors and Treatment

        Astigmatism is an eye condition where either the lens or cornea of the
        eye is deformed and misshapen, disrupting visual abilities and causing
        symptoms such as blurred vision, glare from lights and eye strain. The
        following article will discuss the astigmatism definitions, astigmatism
        causes, astigmatism symptoms, astigmatism treatments and astigmatism
        risk factors.
        <br /><br />
        Astigmatism is defined as a refractive error, a term that is also used
        for conditions such as nearsightedness and presbyopia. Astigmatism is
        caused by a misshapen lens or cornea that disrupts the eyes’ visual
        abilities. Symptoms of astigmatism include blurred vision, hazy vision,
        glares, eye fatigue and poor night vision. Astigmatism can be treated by
        wearing prescription glasses or contact lenses. Risk factors of
        astigmatism include ageing or environmental factors such as persistent
        digital device usage.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Corneal Astigmatism</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Corneal astigmatism refers to a type of astigmatism where
          <b>the cornea of the eye</b>, the part of the window at the front of
          the eye that lets light in,
          <b
            >is misshapen or deformed, causing blurred vision and disrupting the
            cornea’s ability to focus light onto the retina</b
          >. Changes in the shape of the cornea from spherical to a more ovular,
          egg-like shape results in astigmatism. Corneal astigmatism is
          different from lenticular astigmatism because in corneal astigmatism
          only the cornea is misshapen, while the lens is still in prime
          condition. Corneal astigmatism is additionally more common than
          lenticular astigmatism, according to Better Vision Guide, an online
          information centre dedicated to vision correction surgery.
        </p>

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">2. Lenticular Astigmatism</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Lenticular astigmatism refers to a type of astigmatism where
          <b>the lens on the eye</b>, the part of the eye that provides
          additional magnification power and helps to focus light,
          <b
            >is misshapen or deformed, interfering with the eyes’ ability to
            receive, bend and focus light onto the retina</b
          >. The retina creates images from the light seen by the eye, and sends
          it to the brain through the optic nerve. The lens of the eye is also
          known as the crystalline lens. Although the symptoms of lenticular
          astigmatism are functionally identical to the symptoms of corneal
          astigmatism, lenticular astigmatism is a rarer condition.

            bulged and conical in shape</b

          keratoconus changes shapes the cornea may result in symptoms of

          However, it must be noted that while all eyes with keratoconus have

          focus more intensely to overcome the visual compromises caused by
          astigmatism, they become more exhausted and strained, causing an
          uncomfortable feeling in the eyes and possibly headaches.

        <p class="para-content">
          Blurry vision refers to <b>vision that is hazy or distorted</b>.
          Blurry vision is a common symptom of astigmatism that is caused by the
          misshapen cornea or lens disrupting how light hits the retina. The
          retina is located at the back of the eye and has cells that transmit
          light to the brain via the optic nerve. If someone has astigmatism,
          the misshapen cornea or lens does not refract light to the retina
          properly, leading to blurry vision at near and far distances.

          <b>Symptoms of astigmatism usually occur from birth onwards</b>,
          according to Mayo Clinic, an American health clinic and information
          database. Early symptoms of astigmatism may not be obvious enough to
          be noticeable from a young age. A difficulty in diagnosing astigmatism
          early is that a child of a young age may not realise their vision is
          compromised or blurry.

          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Abnormal corneal shape:</span> Abnormal

          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Age:</span> Age is a risk factor of

            Eye strain is an eye condition caused by prolonged focus on a single
