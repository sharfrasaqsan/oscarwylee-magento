        Eye allergies, also known as allergic conjunctivitis, are
        <b
          >a reaction the body has towards certain substances that directly make
          contact with the eyes, such as pollen or pet dander</b
        >. This substance then triggers an overreaction in the immune system,
        causing symptoms typical of allergic reactions in the face and eyes.
        This article will cover the eye allergies types, causes, eye allergies
        symptoms and eye allergies treatments. <br /><br />
        Types of eye allergies include seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, which
        defines allergies triggered by pollen or plant fibres, and atopic
        keratoconjunctivitis, which is a genetic allergy that can have multiple
        triggers and occur all year round.
        <br /><br />
        Eye allergies, or an allergy in the eye, have many different causes,
        such as pollen, dust, pet dander or smoke, as well as genetic reasons
        that can result in eyes that have an allergic reaction to certain
        climates.
        <br /><br />
        Symptoms of eye allergies include swelling, sneezing, itchy eyes, red
        eyelids and eyes that are constantly tearing or watering. Eye allergy
        treatments involve a variety of medications, such as antihistamines, eye
        drops or allergy shots. These methods typically involve reducing or
        blocking the creation of histamines, or preventing the more
        uncomfortable symptoms of eye allergies.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What are Eye Allergies?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Eye allergies, also known as allergic conjunctivitis, is an eye
        condition in which the body has a reaction towards certain substances
        that make direct contact with the eyes, such as pollen or pet dander.
        This substance then triggers an overreaction in the immune system, in
        order to expel the substances as quickly as possible, causing symptoms
        typical of allergic reactions in the face and eyes.
        <br /><br />
        <i>What are eye allergies?</i><br />
        Eye allergies are different types of allergic reactions specific to the
        eyes that are either caused by the presence of allergic substances, or
        by genetic conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis, which is an
        allergic reaction to seasonal climates specific to certain people.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What are the Other Terms for Eye Allergies?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        The other terms for eye allergies include the medical term. Eye
        allergies are medically known as allergic conjunctivitis, and are often
        referred to specifically as the type of
        <b>allergic conjunctivitis</b> the person with eye allergies is
        suffering from, such as seasonal allergic conjunctivitis or perennial
        allergic conjunctivitis. Eye allergies are also known as ocular
        allergies.

      <h2 class="subtitle">How are Eye Allergies Developed?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Eye allergies are developed
        <b>in reaction to a person's natural allergies and any substance</b>,
        whether constant or seasonal,
        <b>that could trigger an allergic response from the body's system</b>.
        Allergies are defined as a harmless or normal substance that creates an
        overreaction in the body's immune system, due to a white blood cell
        called the mast cell. <br /><br />
        The mast cell can be found in the entirety of the body and controls the
        release and production of certain chemicals that assist the immune
        system. One of these chemicals is histamine, which assists in keeping
        toxic, hostile or unwanted substances out of the body, such as
        infections that could be caused by injury, but in reaction to a
        technically harmless substance such as an allergen, will cause
        uncomfortable symptoms such as puffy eyes, swelling, a runny nose and a
        feeling of nausea.
        <br /><br />
        There are many reasons why allergies develop, but the most common is a
        family history of certain types of allergies.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">How Common are Eye Allergies?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Eye allergies are very common across the world. According to Health
          Direct, over 1 in 5 people are affected by hay fever and eye allergies
          in Australia.
          <br /><br />
          Unique types of eye allergies can affect different demographics
          depending on a range of factors, such as location and gender.
          According to Jordan Scott Masters, writing for the American Academy of
          Ophthalmology, eye conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis
          occur most notably in hot and dry climates such as West Africa and
          disproportionately affect males under the age of 25.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is a type of

            lands directly in the eye</b
          >, causing an allergic reaction. <br /><br />
          Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is different from other types of eye
          allergies because the cause of the reaction can be found in the
          household or outside world all year round. The substance that causes
          the allergies may be different for everyone and the symptoms of
          perennial allergic conjunctivitis are milder and less severe than
          seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.
          <br /><br />
          Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is diagnosed by a doctor or eye
          health professional examining the eyes and finding symptoms such as
          redness, swelling or burning of the eyes as well as mild symptoms of
          other allergic reactions, such as a runny nose or sneezing. A person’s
          history of allergies and what causes their allergies may also be

            is severely allergic to the substance</b
          >. <br /><br />
          Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is different from other types of eye
          allergies because the symptoms of the allergic reaction are much more
          intense and severe in the eye, and in some cases may lead to permanent
          blindness if the condition is not properly treated, according to the
          American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.
          <br /><br />
          Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is diagnosed by a doctor or eye health
          professional examining the eyes for symptoms, such as itching, tearing
          in the eye as well as constant creation of a thick mucus, the
          sensation of there being something in the eye, a sensitivity to light,
          and hard, round bumps being clearly seen on the eyelid.

          that causes an overreaction in the body's immune system,
          <b>lands directly in the eye</b>. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is
          closely associated with hay fever and is most common during seasons of
          high pollen. <br /><br />
          Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is different from other types of eye
          allergies because it is specifically caused by allergens that occur in
          spring and summer seasons and is most commonly caused by grass and
          plant pollen instead of substances that can be found all year round.
          <br /><br />
          Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is diagnosed by a doctor or eye
          health expert examining the eyes for symptoms of SAC, such as red or
          itching eyes, dark circles under the eyes, runny eyes or a runny nose
          and other common signs of hay fever.

          Contact allergic conjunctivitis is a type of eye allergy where
          <b>the usage of contact lenses is causing an allergic reaction</b>.
          Contact allergic conjunctivitis is caused by the proteins in the tears
          binding to the surface of the lenses and irritating the conjunctiva.
          <br /><br />
          Contact allergic conjunctivitis is different from other types of eye
          allergies because it is directly caused by the usage of contact lenses
          or allergenic materials lining the eye.
          <br /><br />
          Contact allergic conjunctivitis is diagnosed by a doctor or an eye
          health professional by checking the eye for symptoms such as itching
          and redness of the eye, excessive mucus release and uncomfortable
          lenses.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">5. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Giant papillary conjunctivitis, also known as GPC, is a form of eye
          allergy where the inside of the eyelid begins showing the symptoms of
          an allergic reaction, redness, itching or swelling, and bumpy sacs
          inside the eyelid, called papules, begin forming.
          <br /><br />

          <b>the reaction to the contact lenses is much more severe</b> and if
          giant papillary conjunctivitis is not treated, it
          <b>may result in permanent intolerance towards contact lenses</b> or a
          separate eye condition called ptosis, or drooping eyelids.
          <br /><br />
          Giant Papillary conjunctivitis is diagnosed by a doctor or an eye
          health professional by examining the eye for symptoms of an allergic
          reaction, such as itching or redness, and also by examining the inside
          of the eyelid to see if the surface is smooth or bumpy due to GPC.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">6. Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a type of
          <b>genetic eye allergy that can occur all year round</b>. Atopic
          keratoconjunctivitis is caused by a separate genetic condition called
          atopy, which causes the immune system to produce an excess of
          antibodies when the body reacts to the presence of an allergen. The
          people who suffer from atopic keratoconjunctivitis are most often
          older men. <br /><br />
          Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is different from other types of eye
          allergies because it is a genetic condition that is directly tied to
          atopy and its symptoms. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis also affects the
          lower eyelid more noticeable than other conditions, such as vernal
          keratoconjunctivitis. atopic keratoconjunctivitis that is untreated
          may lead to conditions such as amblyopia or may result in scarring of
          the cornea, which will affect sight.
          <br /><br />
          Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is diagnosed by a doctor or eye health
          professional examining the eye and finding symptoms such as light
          sensitivity, itching, burning eyes, red and swollen eyelids and
          tearing eyes.

      </p>

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Pet dander:</span>
          Pet dander is a cause of eye allergies because pet dander may trigger
          a person's animal allergies if the pet dander comes into contact with
          the skin or eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Pollen:</span>
          Pollen is a cause of eye allergies because the release of plant pollen
          triggers histamine release in the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Mould:</span>
          Mould is a cause of eye allergies because certain types of mould
          particles, such as penicillium, can be an allergen and will cause an
          allergic reaction if it makes contact with the eyes or skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Smoke:</span>
          Smoke is a cause of eye allergies because smoke particles may be an
          allergen that triggers an allergic reaction if the particle makes
          contact with the body or eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Dust:</span>
          Dust is a cause of eye allergies because the many particles that make
          up dust may be considered an allergen by the body.

      </ul>

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Pet Dander</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Pet dander is defined as the microscopic flakes of dead skin that fall
          off of household animals such as dogs or cats. Pet dander typically
          lingers or sticks to surfaces and can linger in an area for four to
          six months.
          <br /><br />
          Pet dander is a cause of eye allergies because
          <b>pet dander triggers the body's response to animal allergies</b> if
          a person is allergic to that animal. This creates the chemical
          histamine in the system, which will cause red and watery eyes as well

          Pollen is a yellow-coloured powder produced by plants that releases
          during certain seasons in the year, with some seasons seeing a greater
          release of pollen than others.
          <br /><br />
          Pollen is a cause of eye allergies because like many forms of
          allergens
          <b>the body believes it is a harmful substance and overreacts</b> when
          pollen comes into contact with the eyes or body, most noticeably
          releasing a chemical known as <b>histamine</b> that causes swelling,
          redness and watering in the eyes.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">3. Mould</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Mould is a type of fungal growth that occurs on organic matter that is
          decaying or has been wet for an extended period of time.
          <br /><br />
          Mould is a cause of eye allergies because
          <b>the body may react to certain specific types of mould spores</b> in
          the air as the spores make contact with the eyes or skin. Not all
          types of mould cause an allergic reaction, most commonly, mould
          allergies are caused by mould types such as cladosporium or

          caused as a reaction to fire or other burning substances.
          <br /><br />
          Smoke is a cause of eye allergies because

          Eye infections also do not commonly cause eye itching. Itching is most
          commonly a symptom of eye allergies, according to John Hopkins
