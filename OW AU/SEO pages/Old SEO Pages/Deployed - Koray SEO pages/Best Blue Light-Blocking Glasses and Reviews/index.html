          <p class="minusPadding">
            The best blue light-blocking glasses will be a combination of form,
            function and effectiveness. Just like any pair of glasses, blue
            light glasses are an investment in eye care and, therefore, it is
            important to choose the best one for you and your needs. If you
            spend much of your time in front of a screen such as on a computer
            for work, school or gaming, or find you cannot put your phone down
            at nighttime, we recommend you add a blue light filter to your
            glasses.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, our blue light filter is a fixed additional $80 on
            top of any pair of optical glasses, prescription or
            non-prescription. The total price will depend on other add ons or
            lens types such as multifocal or high index lenses.
            <br /><br />
            The criteria for the best blue light glasses can be chosen for the
            effectiveness of the blue light filter, the price of frame and the
            style of frame. The reasons blue light glasses are chosen are listed
            below.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Effectiveness of blue light filter:</b> How effective the
              glasses are at blocking blue light is the most important factor
              when choosing what blue-light glasses to buy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Price of frame:</b> Price is another key factor as some people
              may try to find the cheapest price or are looking for a bigger
              investment in their blue light-blocking glasses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Style of frame:</b> The style and design of the frame of your
              blue light glasses is a main consideration when choosing these
              glasses as you can be wearing them for most of the day, therefore,
              you want to choose a style you feel confident and comfortable in.

          <h2>How to Choose the Best Blue Light-Blocking Glasses?</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing the best blue light-blocking glasses involves assessing the
            effectiveness of the glasses, selecting the right lenses, finding
            the best frames, knowing the importance of corrective lenses and how
            price affects the choice. The reasons these activities are involved
            in choosing the best blue light glasses are listed below.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Effectiveness of Blue Light-Blocking Glasses</h3>
          <p>
            The effectiveness of blue light-blocking glasses can be measured by
            their ability to block the artificial blue light that is emitted
            from digital screens and other mediums such as LED light bulbs.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Lenses of Blue Light-Blocking Glasses</h3>
          <p>
            The lenses of blue light glasses will have a blue light filter
            applied and can also include an anti-glare coating. Blue light
            glasses can be both prescription and non-prescription, meaning the
            lenses can have a corrective prescription or be plain.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Importance of Frames for Blue Light-blocking Glasses</h3>
          <p>
            Frames are important for choosing blue light-blocking glasses as you
            want to choose a style you like and will be happy to wear for the
            majority of the day. You can choose frames depending on the shape of
            your face such as rectangle-shaped glasses for a round face. If you
            like the Ray-Ban style of glasses, while we do not sell this brand
            at Oscar Wylee, we have a wide range of styles that are sure to meet
            your tastes.
          </p>

          <h3>
            4. Importance of Corrective Lenses for Blue Light-blocking Glasses
          </h3>
          <p>
            At Oscar Wylee, blue light glasses can come in both prescription and
            non-prescription. This means that not only can you make your glasses
            blue light blocking, but you also acquire the vision correction you
            need.
          </p>

          <h3>
            5. Price Criteria for Choosing the Right Blue Light-Blocking Glasses
          </h3>
          <p>
            The price of blue light-blocking glasses can vary from pair to pair
            and can also depend on the other aspects of the glasses such as
            add-ons, prescription and frame. At Oscar Wylee, you can add a blue
            light filter to any pair of optical glasses for an additional $80
            which includes an anti-glare coating.

            can also grab two pairs of glasses from $199 and 3 pairs from $249.
          </p>

          <h4>Why do Yellow Lenses Block Blue Light Better?</h4>
          <p>
            Yellow lenses block blue light better because they absorb blue light
            better than clear glasses. A yellow-tinted lens eradicates the blue
            aspect from the light spectrum, enhancing your viewing experience. A
            yellow tint on blue light glasses allows for optimal clarity and can
            enhance depth perception and contrast.

            What are Alternatives to Blue Light Glasses without Yellow Tint?

            The alternatives to blue light glasses without a yellow tint include
            clear blue light glasses. These types of blue light-blocking glasses

          <h2>How do Blue Light-Blocking Glasses Work?</h2>
          <p>
            Blue light blocking glasses work by reducing your exposure to the
            potentially harmful artificial blue light by blocking these rays
            produced by screens. You can wear them when doing computer work,
            spending hours gaming or simply when on your phone. <br /><br />
            While blue light blocking glasses are effective at filtering
            artificial blue light emitted from digital screens, research is
            still early to conclusively say they are successful in shielding
            your eyes from harm. Despite this, there is substantial evidence
            indicating that wearing blue light glasses is beneficial for sleep
            regulation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention (CDC), exposure to blue light can make it difficult to
            fall and stay asleep by affecting your circadian rhythm.
            <br /><br />
            According to one of our Oscar Wylee optometrists, looking through
            blue light glasses can make lights appear dimmer, filtering out
            excess light that helps with symptoms, especially to those who are
            generally light-sensitive.
          </p>

          <h3>Are Blue Light Glasses Worth it?</h3>
          <p>
            The question of whether blue light glasses are worth it, varies from
            person to person and depends on what they are hoping to get out of
            these glasses. If your career or lifestyle relies heavily on using
            digital devices, we recommend using blue light glasses. <br /><br />
            While the research is not yet concrete, blue light glasses do not
            cause any harm to the eye and can be helpful in reducing symptoms
            from looking at a screen. Oscar Wylee’s blue light glasses also have
            99% UV protection which is an added benefit.
            <br /><br />
            According to the Life Science Journal, it appears that blue light
            filters may be helpful to improve the comfort of computer users from
            suffering dry eyes and can reduce ocular discomfort.

              thin layer placed on the lens that removes any reflections you
              might normally see from the surface of your glasses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Magnification/prescription:</b> A small amount of magnification
              can prevent squinting. This is especially beneficial for people
              who spend much of their time gaming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tinted lens:</b> Blue light glasses can have an amber or yellow
              tint added to the lens which offers an extra buffer against blue
              light.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Lightweight frame:</b> For people who spent long periods of
              time in front of a screen, it is essential to have blue light
              glasses that are comfortable so you can wear them all day long.

          <h3>Are Blue Light Blocking Glasses Used for Computers?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, blue light blocking glasses are used when on a computer as they
            block the artificial light that is emitted from the screen. Computer
            glasses often include an intermediate prescription to help you see a
            computer screen more clearly and comfortably. They will always have
            an anti-reflective coating applied to them as well as a blue light
            filter to help further reduce potential eye strain induced by blue
            light.

          <h3>Are Blue Light Blocking Glasses Used for the TV?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, blue light-blocking glasses can be used when watching TV. Your
            television emits artificial blue light just as your computer or
            phone screen does. The majority of modern televisions will have an
            in-built blue light filter which can be switched on and off when you
            desire. While it is not always possible to limit your TV time,
            wearing blue light glasses can help with this issue.

            What is the Difference Between Sunglasses and Blue Light-blocking
            Glasses?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The main difference between sunglasses and blue light-blocking
            glasses is that they are designed for different purposes. Polarised
            sunglasses offer UV protection and also cut out glare but they do
            not block or filter blue light rays. Blue light glasses, on the
            other hand, are specifically designed to block the artificial blue
            light that is emitted from digital screens. Our blue light glasses
            at Oscar Wylee also include a strong UV blocking of 99% which is
            beneficial for situations when we do not have sunglasses on hand.
