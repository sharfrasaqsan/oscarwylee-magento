          <h1>Eye: Definition, How does it Work, Anatomy, and Functions</h1>
          <p>
            The eye is defined as the part of the human body that creates and
            controls how and what a person is capable of seeing. The anatomy of
            the eye is made up of several parts, each with its own purpose in
            protecting the eye or assisting with sight. The eye receives light
            through the pupil which is sent to the lens which bends and
            transforms shapes in order to send light to the retina and macula,
            which creates images to send to the brain through the optic nerve.
            The eye anatomy is made up of the outer layer, which receives light
            and protects the other layer, the middle layer, which nourishes the
            eye and contains the most blood of the eye, and the inner layer,
            which receives light and transforms the light into images to send to
            the brain.
            <br /><br />
            Eye colour and eye shape vary heavily from person to person. The
            eye-seeing ability is affected by damage, diseases and eye
            conditions, and blue light wavelengths. Other animals, such as
            eagles, have different makeup in their eye anatomy that affects
            their vision and allows them to see clearer or sharper than the
            human eye is capable of seeing.

          <h2>What is the Eye?</h2>
          <p>
            The eye is an organ in the human body that controls sight and allows
            a person to see. It is an asymmetrical globe located in the head.
            The eye contains the white part of the eye, the sclera, and the
            iris, which is where the pigmentation that determines eye colour is
            located. The eye is similar to an organic camera located in the
            head's socket, it is capable of focusing on one single object for
            the sake of visual clarity and perceiving as much detail as possible
            while blurring any irrelevant or non-focused aspects of the
            immediate image.
            <br /><br />
            The evolution of the eye is not a clear matter. The eye was believed
            to have evolved from organic mechanics that helped the body to find
            and keep a circadian rhythm: the ability to tell night and day
            outside for the sake of knowing when to rest and when to wake up and
            take action in the daytime, according to I R Schwab, from the
            University of California’s Department of Ophthalmology & Vision
            Science, during a lecture on the development of the ocular toolkit.
          </p>

          <h2 class="topMarginRes">How Does the Human Eye Work?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The human eye works by absorbing light through the pupil and iris,
            focusing the light through the lens and forming the light it
            receives through the macula and retina. The eye creates sight by
            absorbing light wavelengths from the outside world through the outer
            layer of the eye. The outer layer of the eye contains the white part
            of the eye, called the sclera, the cornea and the iris. The eye
            takes this light and uses the inner layer of the eye to create an
            image from the light the outer layer received. The inner layer of
            the eye contains the retina and the optic nerve. The middle layer of
            the eye is used to nourish the eye and contains the choroid and the
            iris.
            <br /><br />
            The eye must stay moist to function properly, and has parts and
            functions that create tears in order to supply constant lubrication.

          </div>

          <h3>1. Choroid</h3>
          <p>
            The choroid is a layer of the eyes located between the sclera and
            the retina. According to ScienceDirect, the choroid is made up
            predominantly of blood vessels and accounts for much of the blood
            flow found within the eyes. The choroid’s first function in the eye
            is to use the blood flow to provide nutrients and sustenance to
            other vital parts of the eye, such as the retina, macular and optic
            nerve. The second function of the choroid is to shield the eye from
            possibly harmful light and reflection. The protective part of the
            choroid is what causes ‘red eye’ in photography. <br /><br />
            If the choroid is damaged the retina begins bleeding. The damage
            eventually results in the loss of peripheral vision.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Ciliary Body</h3>
          <p>
            The ciliary body is a circular ring that is connected to the iris.
            The ciliary body is one of three parts that form the middle layer of
            the eye. The other parts of the middle layer are the choroid and the
            iris. <i>The first function</i> of the ciliary body is to hold the
            lens in place in the eye using the <b>ciliary muscle</b> which also
            helps to accommodate the lens, making the lens able to change shape
            and focus the eyes. <i>The second function</i> of the ciliary body
            is to use <b>the ciliary processes</b> to produce a fluid in the eye
            called <b>aqueous humour</b>. Aqueous humour is a visible, clear
            fluid that is vital for nourishing the eye and helps the eye to
            maintain its shape. <br /><br />
            Damage to the ciliary body results in blurred vision and an
            inability to focus. Damage to the ciliary body results in complete
            vision loss if it is left untreated.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Cone Cells</h3>
          <p>
            Cone cells are found near the macula of the eye and help to perceive
            colours and details. There are 6 million cone cells found within the
            eye. <i>The first function</i> of cone cells is to help convert
            light into signals to send to the brain as they are photoreceptors
            which are cells in the eye that are sensitive to light. Cone cells
            are one of two types of photoreceptors found within the eye. The
            other type of photoreceptor is the eye rods and their variations.
            There are three types of cone cells:
            <b>red-sensing cone cells, blue-sensing cone cells</b> and
            red-sensing cone cells, <b>blue-sensing cone cells</b>. Each type of
            cone cell functions to help the eye perceive the pigmentation of the
            cone cells sensing colour. <br /><br />
            Cone cells are responsible for colour vision within the eye.
            <i>The second function</i> of cone cells and rod cells is to
            translate light into electric signals and then send them to the
            brain through the optic nerve. <br /><br />
            Damage to the cone cells results in sensitivity to light, less
            visual information when looking straight ahead and difficulty seeing
            colour.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Cornea</h3>
          <p>
            The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eye,
            according to the National Eye Institute. It is located in the very
            front portion of the eye, directly covering the pupil, iris and
            anterior chamber. <i>The first function</i> of the cornea is to
            control how much light enters the eyes and focus the light that is
            received. The cornea bends and refracts any light the eye receives
            by changing size, becoming smaller or larger, depending on the
            volume of light entering the eye. The cornea is the first contact
            light has with the human eye and serves to focus the majority of the
            light the eye receives. <br /><br />
            The cornea’s second function is to protect the eye by filtering out
            harmful glare from the eye, such as ultraviolet rays from sunlight.
            The cornea is equipped to deal with minor damage, such as cuts,
            scars or other abrasions.
            <br /><br />
            Heavy damage to the cornea results in distorted vision and a lesser
            ability to see light.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Conjunctiva</h3>
          <p>
            The conjunctiva is a thin layer of tissue, referred to as a mucous
            membrane, that covers the whites of the eye and lines the inside of
            the eyelid. The conjunctiva’s layer of tissue is clear and
            see-through. It is located in the outer layer of the eye.
            <i>The first function</i> of the conjunctiva is to secrete fluids
            that keep the eyes lubricated and protected from infections and
            outside bacteria and bodies, such as dust or other bodies.
            <br /><br />
            The conjunctiva itself is made up of three aspects, the
            <b>bulbar conjunctiva</b>, the palpebral conjunctiva and the fornix
            conjunctiva. The bulbar conjunctiva is the section that covers the
            sclera but not the cornea. The <b>palpebral conjunctiva</b> is the
            section that covers the eyelid in both its upper and lower parts.
            The <b>fornix conjunctiva</b> is located between the other two
            sections, the fornix conjunctiva allows the eyelid and eyeball
            freedom of movement. <i>The second function</i> of the conjunctiva
            is to ensure no foreign body or object slips behind the eye, such as
            contact lenses. <br /><br />
            Damage to the conjunctiva affects the eyes' appearance, making them
            discoloured and visibly injured and causing conditions such as dry
            eye and blurred vision.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Crystalline Lens</h3>
          <p>
            The crystalline lens is a natural focusing lens in the eyes that
            provides a portion of the optical power found within the eye. It is
            also simply referred to as the lens of the eye.
            <i>The first function</i> of the lens is for bending and focusing
            light by changing shape with its natural elasticity. The lens uses
            its changing shape to shine the light it receives directly into the
            retina, which begins the process of changing outside light into a
            perceivable image. <i>The second function</i> of the lens is to work
            together with the ciliary muscle when focusing in order to see
            distant objects. Part of the crystalline lens' ability to change
            shape is provided by the ciliary muscles’ power. <br /><br />
            When the crystalline lens transfers the light of an image, the image
            is actually received upside down. As light from the crystalline lens
            is transferred to the brain, the optic nerve reverses the image to
            be right-side up.
            <br /><br />
            Damage to the crystalline lens causes cataracts, a dislocated lens
            and blurred vision. Damage to the crystalline lens is irreversible,
            such as scratching or dislocation. Damage to the crystalline lens
            may also affect the iris as the iris loses its support within the
            structure of the eye.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Fovea</h3>
          <p>
            The fovea, or fovea centralis, is a small depression or pit located
            at the centre of the retina that controls the sharpness of central
            vision. The fovea centralis and its surrounding, the parafovea and
            perifovea regions, contain cone cells that assist in vision. The
            fovea itself contains a massive amount of cone cells, which is why
            its main function is for the clarity of central vision and central
            vision's ability to see exact detail. <br /><br />
            Damage to the fovea causes a loss of ability to see colour, perceive
            daytime and would reduce the eye's ability to see sharp details.
            Damage to the fovea is caused by eye conditions such as macular
            degeneration and Stargardt disease. If the fovea is compromised, the
            retina actually forms what is known as a ‘pseudofovea’, according to
            an article written by the Fighting Blindness Foundation in 2013. A
            pseudofovea is a new focal point that optimises the remaining
            photoreceptors in the eye.

          <h3>8. Iris</h3>
          <p>
            The iris is a visible and coloured part of the eye located behind
            the cornea and in front of the crystalline lens.
            <i>The main function</i> of the iris is to control the size of the
            pupil and the eye's general ability to let light in. The iris is a
            muscle that shrinks the pupil in response to too much light and
            widens the pupil if there is too little light. The iris is connected
            to the ciliary body. The iris contains the pigmentation that
            determines what a person's eye colour is, based on genetics and the
            amount of melanin that is within the front layers of the iris.
            <br /><br />
            Damage to the iris changes the appearance of the eye and affects how
            well the eye receives light. This results in intense light
            sensitivity and vision loss.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Macula</h3>
          <p>
            The macula is an area of the eye found in the very centre of the
            back of the eyeball and the retina. It is the central part of the
            retina. <i>The main function</i> of the macula is to translate light
            into images allowing a person to see clear and precise details of
            objects in front of the eyes, such as writing or seeing the details
            of people's faces. The macula is made up of photoreceptor cells like
            rods and cones, which detect light and colour. <br /><br />
            Damage to the macular results in difficulty seeing fine details like
            small print and distortion in general vision. If the damage is
            severe or long-lasting, it results in a ‘black hole’ or black patch
            in a person's vision.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Optic Disc</h3>
          <p>
            The optic disk is a round disc found in the back of the eye. The
            optic disc is also referred to as the optic nerve head and is where
            the optic nerve begins. <i>The first function</i> of the optic disc
            is that it is the exit point for the retinal ganglion cells to leave
            the eye, allowing the cells to transfer signals from the eye’s
            photoreceptors to the optic nerve. <i>The second function</i> of the
            optic disc is it acts as the entry point for the blood vessels that
            supply the retina. The optic disc has no photoreceptors surrounding
            it, and its place in the eye is a small blindspot. <br /><br />
            Damage to the optic disc affects how the optic nerve functions and
            can lead to immediate or gradual loss of vision.
          </p>

          <h3>11. Optic Nerve</h3>
          <p>
            The optic nerve is a long nerve that extends directly out the back
            of the eyes that begins at the optic disc. The optic nerve is made
            up of millions of nerve fibres and its <i>first function</i> is to
            carry messages directly from the eyes towards the brain. It is not
            just part of the eye, but also part of the body's central nervous
            system. The optic nerve is one of the most critical parts of the
            eye, as without it no visual information could be received by the
            brain. The optic nerve is made up of branches of
            <b>retinal ganglion cells</b> and <b>glial cells</b> and its
            <i>second function</i> is that these branches split up and reach out
            into the left and right eye in order to retrieve visual information
            from all possible sources, such as the retina and the fovea. These
            cells reach into the eyes to connect to photoreceptors like the rods
            and cones, and from there send the visual information the receptors
            receive to the brain. <br /><br />
            Damage to the optical nerve will result in vision loss, both
            temporary and permanent depending on the condition of the nerve and
            the cause of the damage. Untreated optic nerve damage leads to
            blindness.
          </p>

          <h3>12. Pupil</h3>
          <p>
            The pupil is an opening in the iris located directly in the centre
            of the eye and covered by the cornea. The pupil is surrounded by the
            <b>iris</b>, which controls its size to maintain how much light is
            allowed inside of the eye depending on the volume of the light being
            viewed. <i>The first function</i> of the pupil is to allow light
            into the eye so it may be focused in the <b>retina</b> by the eye's
            <b>lens</b> and transferred into images.
            <i>The second function</i> of the pupil is that it is the pathway
            that <b>aqueous humour</b> from the <b>ciliary body</b> reaches the
            front of the eye and provides nourishment to all parts of the eye
            near the pupil. <br /><br />
            Damage to the pupil is not directly possible, however damage to the
            iris or the nerves connected to the pupil will result in extreme
            light sensitivity during the day, or when looking at bright light
            and glares. A non-functioning or large dilated pupil is called a
            blown pupil. It is not responsive to light and is caused by severe
            brain trauma, such as a stroke.
          </p>

          <h3>13. Retina</h3>
          <p>
            The retina is a layer of tissue located directly at the back of the
            eye. <i>The retina’s main function</i> is to focus light that comes
            in through the eye's lens and translate that light into images. The
            retina is made up of two parts, the macula, which is responsible for
            the direct frontal vision and the ability to perceive up close and
            small details, such as fine print and the peripheral retina which is
            responsible for vision outside of direct central vision, and for
            what is seen from the corners of the eye. <br /><br />
            Damage to the retina results in blurred vision, seeing floating
            spots or flashes of light.
          </p>

          <h3>14. Rod Cells</h3>
          <p>
            Rod cells are photoreceptors in the eye that are highly sensitive to
            light and shapes and are located within the retina.
            <i>The first function</i> of rod cells is to provide good vision
            when a person is in low light. <i>The second function</i> of rod
            cells is to perceive the size, shape and brightness of an image that
            they are activated by. Rod cells do not respond to colour and are
            not responsible for colour vision. They are much more sensitive to
            light than cone cells. According to the National Library of
            Medicine, there are approximately 120 million rod cells within the
            retina. Rod cells are located around the periphery of the retina,
            compared to the cone cells found in the macula and the fovea.
            <br /><br />
            Damage to the rod cells results in night blindness, diminished
            periphery vision, light sensitivity and photophobia.
          </p>

          <h3>15. Sclera</h3>
          <p>
            The sclera is the visible whites of the eye. They are located on the
            outer layer of the eye, by the cornea. The sclera is a form of
            tissue made up of 4 layers, <b>the episclera</b>, loose tissue that
            rests on top of the whites of the eyeballs, <b>the stroma</b>, made
            up of collagen tough fibres, the same thick material as the cornea,
            <b>the lamina fusca</b>, made up of elastic fibres that help
            transition the sclera between the choroid and the ciliary body, and
            <b>the endothelium</b>, the innermost layer of the sclera, which
            contains pigments. <br /><br />
            <i>The sclera’s main function</i> is to hold the shape of the
            eyeball through its strong fibres. The sclera is the part of the eye
            that moves using the eyelid muscles in order for the eye to see in
            different directions. <br /><br />
            Damage to the sclera results in blurry vision, sensitivity to light
            and excessive tearing.
          </p>

          <h3>16. Tear Film</h3>
          <p>
            The tear film covers the entire surface of the eye.
            <i>The first function</i> of the tear film is to keep the eyes
            lubricated. The tear film is reapplied to the eye when a person
            blinks and remains as a constant coating across the ocular surface.
            The tear film is provided by the tear gland, located on the top of
            the eyes, near the eyebrows. <br /><br />
            The tear film is made up of three layers, <b>the lipid layer</b>,
            which holds oils and fatty acids that keeps the tears from drying,
            <b>the aqueous layer</b> where the tears nourish the eye and clean
            away unneeded nourishing particles, and <b>the mucin layer</b>,
            which distributes liquid from the aqueous layer throughout the eye
            and nourishes the cornea. <br /><br />
            <i>The second function</i> of the tear film is to prevent infection
            and keep the surface of the eye smooth and clean, enabling better
            light refraction. <br /><br />
            Damage to the tear film will result in dry, itchy eyes, blurred
            vision and inflammation.
          </p>

          <h3>17. Vitreous Body</h3>
          <p>
            The vitreous body is a gel substance that fills most of the space of
            the eye, from the lens down to the retina. It is also referred to as
            vitreous humour and is the largest part of the eyeball. The fluid of
            the vitreous body is clear, gelatinous and has no colour.
            <i>The first function</i> of the vitreous body is to protect all the
            parts of the eye it covers. <i>The second function</i> of the
            vitreous body is to help the eye keep its spherical shape and hold
            the retina in place. <br /><br />
            Damage to the vitreous body results in shadows appearing in the
            retina, and what many people call ‘floaters’ appearing in eyesight.
          </p>

          <h3>18. Zonules</h3>
          <p>
            Zonules, technically referred to as ‘zonule of Zinn’, are tiny
            fibres that form a band around the lens of the eye. Zonules are made
            of fibrillin, a protein fibre found commonly in protective tissue.
            <i>The first function</i> of zonules is to hold the lens in place
            and connect the lens to the ciliary body.
            <i>The second function</i> of Zonules is to assist the lens in
            changing shape in order to bend light for better vision. The zonules
            strands will pull the lenses to help up-close vision, and flatten
            the lens for distance vision. <br /><br />
            Zonules cannot directly be damaged, however weak or weakened zonules
            result in strange pupil dilation, cataracts and poor functioning of
            the lens, causing blurred vision and an inability to focus the eyes.

          <h2>What is the Function of the Eye?</h2>
          <p>
            The function of the eye is to receive light from the outside world,
            transform that light into a viewable image and then send that image
            to the brain through the optic nerve, creating vision and sight.
            <br /><br />
            The eye magnifies the images it receives and assists the brain in
            focusing and storing information.
          </p>

          <h3>How Does the Eye Perform its Visual Acuity?</h3>
          <p>
            The eye performs visual acuity by receiving light through the
            cornea, which is then adjusted by the pupil and iris to control how
            much light goes into the eye and how much light the lens receives.
            The lens then sends the light to the retina, a layer of the eye
            found directly at the back of the eye’s structure. On the way to the
            retina, the light will pass through the macula, the central part of
            the retina that controls central vision and the vitreous body, which
            dilutes the light. The retina then sends electrical signals to the
            brain through the optic nerve in order to create a visible image.
          </p>

          <h3>How do Eyes Perceive Colours?</h3>
          <p>
            The eye perceives colour through the cone cells and rod cells,
            photoreceptors found inside the retina and the macula. When light
            wavelengths hit the eyes, the cones are stimulated and send a signal
            through the optical nerve to the brain. There are three different
            types of cone cells, red-sensing cone cells, blue-sensing cone cells
            and green-sensing cone cells, each of which is stimulated to
            determine which colour of light the eye is seeing.
          </p>

          <h3>How do Rod Cells and Cones Help for Light Sensitivity?</h3>
          <p>
            Rod cells and cones help with light sensitivity by responding
            differently to the level of light the eye receives, allowing for
            better vision in low or high light, depending on whether the cone
            cells have enough light to be active or not. <br /><br />
            There are 120 million rod cells in the retina, and 6 million cone
            cells according to the National Library of Medicine. Rod cells are
            responsible for vision at low light, also known as scotopic vision.
            Rod cells have a lesser ability to perceive colour than cone cells
            but are much more sensitive to any light the eye receives.
            <br /><br />
            Cone cells are less sensitive to light but are sensitive to one of
            three colours, red, green and blue, which they only perceive in
            decent lighting. The majority of cone cells are found within the
            fovea, which controls central vision.

            What are the Different Eye Diseases for Different Eye Functions?
          </h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The most common eye diseases are <b>refractive errors</b>, which
            affect <b>age-related macular degeneration</b>, <b>cataracts</b>,
            <b>glaucoma</b> and <b>amblyopia</b>. These eye diseases and the

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Refractive errors:</b> Refraction errors are caused by issues
              with the eyes' lenses and the lenses' flexibility. They result in
              blurred vision and an inability to focus on up-close and far away
              objects or see fine detail. According to the Australian Institute
              of Health and Welfare, over 15 million people suffer from
              refractive errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Age-Related Macular Degeneration:</b> Age-related macular
              degeneration is caused by damage to the macular that comes from it
              naturally growing older. Macular degeneration results in a
              diminished ability to see fine details or to see well through the
              eyes' central vision. Over 200 thousand people suffer from macular
              degeneration, according to the Australian Government Department of
              Health and Aged Care.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cataracts:</b> Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the
              eye. They are caused by age or injury. As cataracts are caused by
              ageing they will, at some point, affect all seeing animals in
              their lifetime.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Glaucoma:</b> Glaucoma is an umbrella term for a group of eye
              problems. The root cause of glaucoma is damage to the optical
              nerve. The damage can be caused by high blood pressure, age,
              family genetics, thin cornea, or eye injuries. Glaucoma is the
              leading cause of blindness. Over 300,000 Australians suffer from
              Glaucoma, according to Glaucoma Australia.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Amblyopia:</b> Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, is caused
              most often by a poor balance in the muscles that control the
              positioning of the eyes. The imbalance of the eyes causes one or
              both of them to cross inward or look too far outward. Amblyopia’s
              imbalance causes a risk of other eye diseases due to interference
              with the light the eye receives. These conditions include
              hyperopia and astigmatism. 3 out of 100 children are born with
              amblyopia, according to the National Eye Institute.

          <h3>What are the Different Parts of Eye Layers' Function?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The different parts of the eye’s layers are the inner layer that
            controls sight, the middle later that nourishes the eye and the
            outer layer that protects. The different layers of the eye and their
            functions are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>The middle layer:</b> The middle layer of the eye contains the
              majority of the blood cells, and it contains the parts of the eye
              that feed the entire structure, such as the choroid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The Outer layer:</b> The Outer layer of the eye contains strong
              fibres and layers of tissue found in the cornea, the sclera and
              tears that protect the eye from bacteria, excessive light and
              other outside interference.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The inner layer:</b> The inner layer of the eye controls how
              the eye sees by transforming light into images which are then sent
              to the brain to enable the body's ability to see. It contains the
              retina, optic nerve, macula and fovea.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>What is the Function of the Outer Layer of the Eye?</h4>
          <p>
            The function of the outer layer of the eye is to protect the inner
            layers from damage and to receive light for the rest of the eye, as
            well as containing the eye's focusing power and tears. It is made up
            of the cornea and the sclera.
          </p>

          <h5>What is the Anatomy of the Eye Socket?</h5>

            The eye socket is made up of 7 different bones: the sphenoid, the
            zygomatic, the frontal, the maximally, the lacrimal, the palatine
            and the ethmoid. These bones make up the eye socket, also called the
            ‘orbit’. The eye socket contains fat, muscles and nerves built to
            help hold the globe of the eye within it. At the back of the socket
            is the opening to the optic canal and the optic nerve’s flow to the
            brain.

          <h3>What is the Function of the Middle Layer of the Eye?</h3>
          <p>
            The function of the middle layer of the eye is to nourish the
            entirety of the eye. The middle layer of the eye contains the most
            blood vessels. It is made up of the choroid, the ciliary body and
            the iris. The majority of this layer is the responsibility and
            function of the choroid.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the Function of the Inner Layer of the Eye?</h3>
          <p>
            The function of the inner layer of the eye is to receive light in
            the retina, fovea and macula and transfer the light into an image to
            send to the brain through the optical nerve, creating sight and
            vision.

          <h2>How Did the Eye Evolve?</h2>
          <p>
            The eye evolved from an organism called the trilobites over 541
            million years ago. Trilobites' eyes were compound, similar in makeup
            to an insect. Before trilobites, there were no animals that had
            evolved eyes during the Cambrian explosion. According to I R Schwab,
            the mechanisms that eyes would evolve from were originally
            photoreceptors that could only measure the brightness of the
            immediate area. These photoreceptors evolved in order to help the
            body recognize night from day, and would control the body's
            circadian rhythm, the time it would need to be active and the time
            the body would need to test.
            <br /><br />
            In an article for the New York Times, science writer Carl Zimmer
            stated that the common ancestor of all forms of evolution in the eye
            is a molecule called the opsin. It is the presence of opsin that the
            proto eye reacted to and evolved with in order to accommodate for
            the opsins functions.

          <h3>What is Pigmentation in the Eye?</h3>
          <p>
            Pigmentation in the eye evolved from chromophore, a part of a
            molecule that controls colour. Pigmentation in the eye can be found
            in the iris, and the amount of melanin, a pigmentation that can be
            found in the hair, the eyes and the skin that controls the darkness
            of the pigment's appearance. Pigmentation changes in the eye are
            visible and are a warning sign of damage or macular degeneration.

          <h2>What are the Three Chambers of Fluid in the Eye Ball?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The three chambers of fluid in the eyeball are the anterior chamber,
            found between the cornea and the iris, the posterior chamber,
            located between the zonules and the lens, and the vitreous chamber,
            between the lens and the retina. The first two chambers are filled
            with aqueous humour, a substance that provides nutrition,
            protection, cleaning and moisture to the eye. The third chamber is
            filled with the vitreous body, which maintains the eye's shape.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Anterior Chamber</h3>
          <p>
            The anterior chamber is a space of fluid close to the eye's outer
            layer. The anterior chamber’s function is to hold aqueous humour and
            give the benefits of aqueous humour to the cornea and iris. The
            anterior chamber is also used by eye health professionals to
            determine the risk of glaucoma by measuring the depth of the
            chamber's size.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Posterior Chamber</h3>
          <p>
            The posterior chamber of the eye is a small space behind the iris
            and in front of the lens and ciliary body. The posterior chamber is
            close to the ciliary body and directly receives and stores aqueous
            humour the ciliary body creates, storing it for the middle layer of
            the eye and assisting in nourishing the parts of the eye close to
            it.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Vitreous Chamber</h3>
          <p>
            The vitreous chamber of the eye is a large space behind the lens
            that covers and embodies a large part of the eye. It is filled with
            the vitreous humour, also known as the vitreous body, which is a
            thick substance that helps the lens to magnify its focus and assists
            the eye in keeping its globular shape.

        <div class="textMain boxShadow">
          <h2>What Part of the Eye is Responsible for Vision?</h2>
          <p>
            The retina is the part of the eye directly responsible for vision.
            The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that is light
            sensitive and creates and controls the production of images created
            from light to be sent to the brain through the optic nerve.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What Happens to the Eyes when Exposed to Blue Light from Devices?
          </h3>
          <p>
            When the eye is exposed to blue light from digital devices, it
            associates the light with light emitted from the sun, causing the
            body to feel alert, aware and awake.
          </p>

          <h3>What Part of the Eyes Protects the Eye from Blue Light?</h3>
          <p>
            The eye is protected from blue light by the cornea. However, the
            cornea cannot safely deflect blue light as effectively as other
            wavelengths of light due to blue light’s wavelengths being low, but
            high in energy. This means blue light can penetrate the eyes'
            protection against its energy.
          </p>

          <h3>How Can you Keep your Eyes Healthy?</h3>
          <p>
            There are five main ways to keeping eyes healthy. The first method
            is to <b>eat healthily and have a good diet</b>. By eating well, the
            body will receive Omega 3 fatty acids that the eye needs in order to
            function at its peak level. Fish and green vegetables especially
            contain the premium nutrients needed for healthy eyes. <br /><br />
            The second method to keep your eyes healthy is to
            <b>rest the eyes</b> from artificial light sources and periods of
            intense focus that can result in the eyes drying out or feeling
            fatigued. <br /><br />
            The third method to keep the eyes healthy is to
            <b>wear sunglasses and protect the eyes from UV rays</b>. UV can
            cause damage to the lens of the eye and lead to cancerous growths.
            By wearing sunglasses or other forms of UV protection for the eyes,
            ocular longevity is more guaranteed. <br /><br />
            The fourth method to keep the eyes healthy is to maintain a
            <b>healthy weight and exercise regularly</b>. Diabetes greatly
            increases the chances of glaucoma and other eye health conditions,
            and an improper or unhealthy diet results in the eyes not receiving
            essential nutrition. <br /><br />
            The fifth method to
            <b
              >keep your eyes healthy is to keep a record of family medical
              history</b
            >. Records from optometrists and eye doctors keep track of possible
            hereditary eye diseases, such as Stargardt disease, Choroideremia or
            Cone-rod Dystrophy. Hereditary conditions can be prevented or
            monitored early if they are identified and made known as soon as
            possible.
          </p>

          <h4>Is Blue Light Harmful to the Eyes?</h4>
          <p>
            No, there is not yet any definitive scientific evidence to conclude
            that blue light is harmful to the eyes. However, the effects blue
            light has on the body once it has been received by the eye are
            potentially harmful, and prolonged exposure to blue light may lead
            to dry eyes or cataracts.
          </p>

          <h4>Do Blue Light Glasses Work?</h4>
          <p>
            Blue light glasses can be effective for restoring sleep cycles and
            reducing the eye strain excessive amounts of blue light from digital
            and artificial sources can cause, according to a study performed by
            Chung Shang Medical University.

          <h2>What are the Different Types of Eye in Living Things?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            There are six main different types of eyes in living things. These
            types are sorted into compound eyes and simple eyes. Simple eyes
            have a single type of eye structure that functions together.
            Compound eyes may be made up of entirely photoreceptors, or have
            multiple eye structures inside their makeup. Human eyes can be
            classified as matching multiple categories of eye types. The main
            types of eyes in living things are
            <b
              >pit eyes, reflector eyes, apposition eyes, eyes with refractive
              corneas, eyes with multiple lenses</b
            >, and <b>superposition eyes</b>. The main type of eyes in living
            things are listed below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Pit Eyes:</b> Pit eyes are eyes capable of retracting into a
              pit in the skull in order to reduce the light the eye receives, or
              change the angle of the incoming light. They are classified as
              simple eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reflector eyes:</b> Reflector eyes are eyes that have a layer
              of tissue in the eyes called a tapetum lucidum in place of the
              lens. They are most common in scallops. They are classified as
              simple eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Apposition eyes:</b> Apposition eyes are eyes that can move
              separately and that function by gathering information from each
              eye separately. They are most commonly found in crabs. They are
              classified as compound eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Eyes with refractive corneas:</b> Eyes with refractive corneas
              are eyes that are capable of refraction in the corneas and the
              vitreous body, meaning the outside of the eye can assist the lens
              in focusing the light eye receives. These are human eyes and the
              most common eye type in mammals. Refractive corneas are classified
              as simple eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Eyes with multiple lenses:</b> Eyes with multiple lenses are
              eyes that have more than one lens inside of the eye's structure,
              typically arranged in a line that is similar to a telescope.
              Multiple lenses can be found in eagles and certain spider species.
              They are classified as simple eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Superposition eyes:</b> Superposition eyes are eyes that are
              fixed in place and gather light from all angles expert the
              frontal, central position. Superposition eyes are found in insects
              such as flies. They are classified as compound eyes.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>How Does Eagle Vision differ from Human Vision?</h3>
          <p>
            An eagle's vision is assumed to be 8 times stronger and sharper than
            humans. An eagle's eye contains retinas bigger and full of more
            nerves and photoreceptors than a human does. Eagle eyes contain a
            much deeper fovea, allowing the eye to have more cone cells. This
            means that an eagle can see with 50/20 vision compared to a human's
            20/20. <br /><br />
            Eagles are capable of seeing through each eye individually, meaning
            both eyes do not have to focus on the same target in an eagle's
            vision. This is called monocular vision. Eagles have a set of
            eyelids that humans do not have, called the nictitating membrane.
            The nictitating membrane allows eagles to see with their eyes
            closed.

          <h2>What are the Types of Eye Shapes?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            There are six main types of eye shapes: <b>Hooded</b>,
            <b>upturned</b>, <b>round</b>, <b>monolid</b>, <b>downturned</b> and
            <b>almond</b>. The eye shapes and what they look like are listed
            below.
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Hooded eye shape:</b> A hooded eye shape is when the eyes have
              skin and tissue extending from the eyebrows that cover the top of
              the eyelid. This growth does not cover the eye itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Upturned eye shape:</b> An upturned eye shape means that the
              corner of the outside of the eye turns upwards into the forehead.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Round eye shape:</b> A round eye shape is an eye shape that is
              much more circular than average, exposing more of the whites of
              the sclera
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Monolid eye shape:</b> A monolid eye shape is when the skin of
              the upper eyelids covers the entirety of the inner eye, leaving no
              sight of any upper eye muscles
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Downturned eye shape:</b> A downturned eye shape means that the
              corner of the outside of the eye turns downward, towards the
              mouth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Almond eye shape:</b> An almond eye shape is when the eye
              itself is longer in width than it is wide, being similar in shape
              to an almond nut.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What Determines Eye Color?</h3>
          <p>
            Eye colour is related to the iris and how much melanin, a type of
            pigmentation, is in the iris’s front layer. For instance, people
            with brown eyes have a greater amount of melanin in their eyes than
            those with blue eyes. The amount of melanin in the eyes changes
            depending on many factors, but the major one is genealogy.
          </p>

          <h3>How Does Eye Shape Affect Glasses Frame Style?</h3>
          <p>
            Eye shape affects glasses frame style by having an outward
            appearance that is more suitable for specific styles of frames. As
            eye shape will blend with the style of the glasses, it is best to
            choose frames that compliment or are a similar style to the eye
            shape, such as round glasses for round eyes or aviator glasses for
            almond eyes.
