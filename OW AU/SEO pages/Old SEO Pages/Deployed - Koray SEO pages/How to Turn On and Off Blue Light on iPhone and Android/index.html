      How to Turn On and Off Blue Light On iPhone and Android

      <p class="para-content">
        It is important to learn how to turn on and off the blue light on an
        iPhone and Android as it is beneficial for your eyes and the quality and
        quantity of sleep. Blue light is naturally occurring and found in the
        electromagnetic energy spectrum. Natural blue light is emitted from the
        sun and artificial blue light is produced by digital screens such as
        phones, computers and LED light bulbs. A blue light filter is used to
        block the potentially harmful blue light rays as they may cause
        discomfort for the eyes and disrupt a person’s sleep cycle.

        It is important to mitigate the blue light from an iPhone or an Android
        because it may cause eye discomfort and affect sleep. Once you learn how
        to turn off blue light on iPhone, and how to turn off blue light on
        Android devices, you should utilise this at night when on your phone
        before bed to aid in sleep. The blue light filter on an android or
        iPhone may help to ease eye fatigue and regulate the sleep cycle.
        Extended periods of screen time may additionally cause eye discomfort
        known as digital eye strain and a blue light filter may help mitigate
        the symptoms.

        <h2 class="subtitle">What is Blue Light?</h2>
        <p class="intro para-content">
          Blue light is a naturally occurring colour found in the visible light
          spectrum and is emitted from the sun. The blue light spectrum has
          short waves, between a 400 and 500 nanometre range. Longer waves
          include ultraviolet waves, microwaves and radio waves. The naturally
          occurring Blue light from the sun is used by our bodies to help
          regulate the sleep-wake cycle. It does this by producing a hormone
          called melatonin at night in the absence of natural light. Artificial
          blue light is found in digital devices such as smartphones and
          computers.
        </p>

          <h3 class="sub-div-title">Is Blue Light harmful to your eyes?</h3>
          <p class="para-content">
            No, blue light has not proven to be directly harmful to your eyes.
            There is evidence that suggests blue light may affect sleep and that
            using a blue light filter may be beneficial for sleep regulation,
            however, research on the long term effects of blue light is in its
            early stages. According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention), being exposed to blue light makes it difficult to fall
            and stay asleep by affecting your circadian rhythm.
            <br /><br />
            People with busy lifestyles may find it hard to get away from their
            devices before bedtime, which is why it is recommended you take
            measures to minimise your exposure to artificial blue light whether
            that is with blue light filters on your devices or even with blue
            light glasses, which have become extremely popular in the last few
            years. These measures may potentially reduce the blue light emitted
            from digital devices and ease any digital eye strain. According to
            the Life Science Journal, there is evidence that blue light filters
            may be helpful to improve the comfort of computer users from
            suffering dry eyes and they can reduce ocular discomfort.

          How to Turn On and Off Blue Light on iPhone using Night Shift?
        </h2>
        <p class="intro para-content">
          In order to protect yourself from blue light, you can learn how to
          turn on and off the blue light on an iPhone by using Night Shift which
          is only available for iPhone 5s or above. To turn on Night Shift go to
          Settings > Display & Brightness > Night Shift. The instructions on how

            <p class="para-content">
              The first step in enabling Night Shift on the iPhone is to open
              Settings. The Settings application is found on the iPhone home
              screen, also available by searching for settings by sliding down
              on the home screen and typing it in the search.

              Once in the Settings application, tap on Display and Brightness
              which, depending on the generation of iPhone, should be under the
              Control Centre button and above the Home Screen button. You may
              have to scroll down slightly in order to find it. Here you will
              find the Night Shift option as well as Light and Dark Mode and
              Display Zoom.

              Once you have clicked on the Night Shift page, there are three

              automatically shifts the colours of your display to the warmer end
              of the colour spectrum after dark. This may help you get a better
              night’s sleep.”
              <br /><br />
              The first function in Night Shift is Scheduled which you can
              toggle on and off. The next is Manually Enable Until Tomorrow
              which turns Night Shift on until the next day. Lastly, there is
              the Colour Temperature where you adjust the bar to Less Warm and
              More Warm, changing the tone of the screen.

              To turn on Night Shift, toggle the button next to the heading
              "Manually Enable Until Tomorrow". Once Manually Enable Until
              Tomorrow is turned on, the phone screen instantly changes the tone
              of the screen to a warmer colour which diminishes the blue light.
              The iPhone screen then remains on Night Shift until the next day.
              You can additionally schedule when Night Shift begins and ends
              which is explained in the next point.

              <p class="para-content">
                No, the Night Shift function on the iPhone does not totally

                light instead of completely blocking or filtering it. Night
                Shift works by automatically adjusting the colours of the phone
                display to the warmer end of the spectrum which makes the
                display easier on a person’s eyes.

              <p class="para-content">
                No, it is not recommended to keep Night Shift on all the time.
                In the daytime, humans are receiving warmer tones of light from
                the sun, therefore, there is no need for Night Shift to be on
                during the day. There are also studies that suggest Night Shift
                may not be necessary. Dr Tim Brown from the University of
                Manchester said that instead of turning on blue light filters
                that turn the screen a warmer hue, “using dim, cooler, lights in
                the evening and bright warmer lights in the day may be more
                beneficial.”

            <p class="para-content">
              Tap on the Eye Comfort button to access more options for turning
              the blue light filter on and off on the phone. This is a similar
              function to Night Shift on the iPhone. In this section, you will
              see five different options. The first is the button to toggle the
              Eye Comfort Shield on and off. Next is the Adaptive function which
              is automatic and under this is the Custom setting, allowing the
              user to choose the colour temperature. The Set Schedule is the
              next option and finally, there is the Colour Temperature which
              allows users to adjust the warmth of the colours.

              There are two main options in the Eye Comfort section, the first
              is Adaptive. The Adaptive function automatically adjusts the
              screen colours based on the time of day. This function means there
              will be minor adjustments during the day and significantly warmers
              tones at night. If Adaptive is selected, the blue light filter
              will always be on and you don’t need to remember to turn it on or
              off as it will adapt to your surroundings and time of day.

            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              The other Eye Comfort Shield option besides Adaptive is Custom.
              Users have the option to choose Custom to adjust the colour
              temperature of their display. Custom allows a person to select the
              colour temperature according to their preference as they can set a
              schedule for when to apply it. Once Custom is chosen, users can
              swipe the colour temperature bar from less warm to more warm.

              Set Schedule is the next option and it allows users to choose the
              time when the Eye Comfort Shield is on. Within Set Schedule, there
              are three different options to choose from. The first is Always
              on, meaning the eye comfort shield is always applied to the screen
              display. The next is sunset to sunrise, meaning the blue light
              filter is turned on at sunset and turned off at sunrise. Lastly is
              the Custom option, allowing users to set the time from when it is
              on to when it is turned off.

                No, the blue light filter in Android phones does not totally

                No, it is not recommended to keep the blue light filter on all
                the time. However, as Android phones have the Adaptive function,
                it will ensure users are not getting extra warm light in the day
                and cool light in the evenings. According to Dr Tim Brown of the
                University of Manchester, it may not be beneficial to have
                cooler lights in the day and warmer lights in the evening.

              What are the Advantages of Using Blue Light Filter On Your Phone?
            </h2>
            <p class="intro para-content">
              Using a blue light filter on your phone has many advantages such
              as protecting your eyes and regulating sleep. Blue light may
              potentially cause digital eye strain which yields symptoms such as
              blurred/double vision, dry or watery eyes, headaches and increased
              sensitivity to light. The advantages of blue light filters on
              phones are listed below.

            <ol class="ordered-list">
              <li>
                <span class="list-title">Protects the eyes:</span>
                A Blue light filter on phones can potentially reduce the amount
                of blue light entering the eye, protecting it from discomfort.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="list-title">Aids with sleep:</span>
                Blue light filters may help improve sleep by blocking the amount
                of blue light the eyes take in. It has been theorised by many
                organisations, including the CDC, that prolonged exposure to
                blue light may disrupt the sleep cycle by affecting its
                circadian rhythm.

              What are Other Alternatives to Protect Your Eyes from the Blue
              Light Your Devices Emit?
            </h2>
            <p class="para-content">
              There are many other alternatives to protect the eyes from the
              blue light emitted from digital devices. The first is wearing blue
              light glasses which have a filter that blocks artificial blue
              light emitted from devices such as phones. Oscar Wylee offers a
              wide range of glasses that can be made into blue light glasses,
              from vintage to on-trend styles.
              <br /><br />
              Another way to protect the eyes from blue light is by cutting down
              on screen time. Though it may be difficult to get away from
              screens, especially for people who use digital devices for work
              and school, it is very beneficial to reduce time spent in front of
              screens where possible. If you are unable to take significant time
              away from screens you can do small things to ease discomfort such
              as taking small breaks from the screen, blinking often and using
              eye drops to refresh the eyes. Finally, there are screen filters
              you can apply to phones that can limit exposure to artificial blue
              light.

                Do Desktop Computers and Laptops also have a Blue Light Filter?
              </h3>
              <p class="para-content">
                Yes, most desktop computers and laptops will also have a blue
                light filter built into the device. There are also downloadable
                applications that apply a blue light filter on the device. On
                Apple computers, like on iPhones, Night Shift can be applied
                through Displays. Similarly, on Android computers, the blue
                light can be modified in the Display settings.
