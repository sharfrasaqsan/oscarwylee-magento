        Ocular melanoma is defined as a type of eye cancer, often occurring in
        the uveal part of the eye. Ocular melanoma may also be known as uveal
        melanoma or choroidal melanoma, depending on where the melanoma is
        occurring. The causes of ocular melanoma are not definitively known,
        however, there are several risk factors that may increase the likelihood
        of developing ocular melanoma, such as having a fair complexion, having
        light-coloured eyes, being of older age, growths on the eye, a family or
        personal history of melanoma and certain skin conditions. Eye cancer
        symptoms in the case of ocular melanoma may not be apparent in the early
        stages. When symptoms of ocular melanoma occur, they may include an iris
        that has a dark spot, a change in pupil shape, blurry or problematic
        vision, a flashing light sensation, a bulging eye, and changes in the
        eyeball’s position or socket movement. Ocular melanoma can be diagnosed
        by an optometrist or other healthcare professionals using an eye test.
        The tests that may be used in the diagnosis of ocular melanoma may
        include ophthalmoscopy, ultrasound and a biopsy. Treatment for ocular
        melanoma can include eye surgery, photocoagulation, radiation therapy,
        targeted therapy, thermotherapy, active surveillance and immunotherapy.
        Ocular melanoma can be either malignant meaning it can spread, or
        benign, according to NORD the National Organisation for Rare
        Disorders.<br /><br />Ocular melanoma is a rare but serious condition.
        It is important to seek medical attention if you have symptoms of ocular
        melanoma.

      <p class="para-content">
        Ocular Melanoma or eye melanoma, is a type of cancer that occurs in the
        eye. Melanoma is a type of cancer that affects melanin-producing cells,
        which are what give the body its skin colour, according to the Cancer
        Council. As the eyes have melanin-producing cells, called melanocytes,
        melanoma can also occur in the eye. Ocular melanoma, also known as uveal
        melanoma, often occurs in the uvea, which is the middle part of the eye.
        According to NORD, the National Organisation for Rare Disorders, ocular
        melanoma is known to appear often in the choroidal part of the eye,
        found within the uvea. Ocular melanoma may be known as choroidal
        melanoma if it occurs in the choroid. Ocular melanoma is a rare type of
        cancer, however, it is the most common eye-related cancer in adults,
        according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

          What is the Other Term for Ocular Melanoma?

        <p class="para-content">
          There are several other terms for ocular melanoma including uveal
          melanoma. Uveal melanoma refers to ocular melanoma in the uveal part
          of the eye. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye and includes
          several important structures within the eye such as the ciliary body,
          the iris, and the choroid, according to the Cancer Council. Ocular
          melanoma may be referred to as choroidal melanoma if it occurs in the
          choroid. Ocular melanoma may also be referred to as eye cancer, which
          is an umbrella term encompassing ocular melanoma and other types of
          eye cancers.

      <p class="para-content">
        The causes of eye melanoma or ocular melanoma are not definitively
        known. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, ocular
        melanoma develops when pigment cells in the eyes, the melanocytes, grow
        incorrectly and as a result, contain errors. These errors multiply,
        gathering in the eye, and leading to melanoma. Though there are no
        definitive eye cancer causes in the case of ocular melanoma, some risk
        factors may increase the likelihood of melanoma, such as light-coloured
        eyes, fair skin, older age and a family or personal history of melanoma.
        Exposure to UV light has been theorised to be linked to ocular melanoma,
        however, this is a topic of ongoing debate, with inconclusive evidence.

          Ocular melanoma most commonly occurs in the uveal part of the eye. The
          uvea is the middle layer of the eye, with the other layers consisting
          of the sclera at the front of the eye, and the retina at the back,
          according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The uvea contains
          the coloured part of the eye called the iris, muscle tissue called the
          ciliary body and the choroid according to NORD, the National
          Organisation for Rare Disorders.

            Older age and gender do play a factor in the risk of developing
            ocular melanoma, as well as how the melanoma may present itself.
            Older age is considered a risk factor for ocular melanoma, with the
            average age of diagnosis in Australia at 62 years, according to the
            Australian Cancer Council. Gender is a factor that may also play a
            role in the development and presentation of ocular melanoma.
            According to the American Cancer Society, ocular melanoma is
            marginally more common in men than women. A further study by Damato
            and Coupland titled Differences in uveal melanomas between men and
            women from the British Isles posits that the presentation of uveal
            melanoma in men and women can also be different, with men displaying
            uveal melanoma that was larger in size than women.

        What are the Signs and Symptoms of Ocular Melanoma?
      </h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        Ocular melanoma is a type of eye cancer that may not initially cause
        obvious signs or symptoms. According to NORD, the National Organisation
        for Rare Disorders, signs and symptoms of ocular melanoma can be
        dependent upon the size of the melanoma, its location and whether or not
        it is affecting the retina. When signs and symptoms of ocular melanoma
        occur, they may include an iris that has a dark spot, a change in pupil
        shape, blurry or problematic vision, a flashing light sensation, a
        bulging eye, and differences in the position or movement of the eyeball
        in the eye socket. If you have any symptoms of the eye cancer known as
        ocular melanoma, is important to see an optometrist as soon as possible.
        The possible ocular melanoma symptoms are listed below.

        <p class="para-content">
          An iris that has a visible dark spot on it, often one that is growing,
          may be a sign of ocular melanoma. The iris is the coloured part of the
          eye. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the iris helps to control the
          pupil, which allows the control of the amount of light into the eye..
          Some forms of ocular melanoma may not be visible to the eye,
          especially if they are deeper in the layers of the eye like in the
          uvea or choroid. Ocular melanoma may also present as a dark spot on
          the whites of the eye or on the conjunctiva.

        <p class="para-content">
          A change in pupil shape may be a sign or symptom of ocular melanoma.
          The pupil is the dark circular structure at the front of the eye,
          surrounded by the iris, also known as the coloured part of the eye.
          The role of the pupil is to help let light into the eye. If the pupil
          has changed in shape or size, including getting larger or looking like
          an asymmetrical abstract shape, this may indicate that ocular melanoma
          is present.

        <p class="para-content">
          Blurry or problematic vision can be a symptom of ocular melanoma.
          Blurry vision refers to vision that is not sharp and looks cloudy or
          hazy. According to NORD, the National Organisation for Rare Disorders,
          if ocular melanoma occurs in the ciliary body, it may affect the lens
          of the eye, which may lead to this blurred vision. Problematic vision
          can refer to several vision impairments, however, in the case of
          ocular melanoma, problematic vision can include loss of peripheral
          vision or seeing floaters. Loss of peripheral vision means the loss of
          vision on the sides, out of the corner of your eyes. Seeing floaters
          can be defined as seeing specks or spots in a person’s vision.
          Floaters can be a result of a change in the fluid that fills the eye,
          called vitreous fluid.
          <br /><br />
          If you have blurry or problematic vision such as peripheral vision
          loss or eye floaters, it is important to seek advice from an
          optometrist as soon as possible.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">4. Flashing Light Sensation</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          A flashing light sensation, referring to the sensation of seeing
          flashes or streaks of light in a person’s vision, may be a symptom of
          melanoma. A flashing sensation in the eye is often caused when the
          vitreous gel in the eye gets smaller in size or alters in some way,
          which pulls on the retina, according to the American Academy of
          Ophthalmology. The retina is the layer of the eye that receives light,
          turns this light into electrical signals and sends them to the optical
          nerve. According to the New York Eye Cancer Centre, choroidal melanoma
          can affect the retina and optic nerve, which may lead to this
          light-flashing sensation.

        <p class="para-content">
          Ocular melanoma is a very serious eye condition that should be
          assessed, monitored and treated by a healthcare professional. Ocular
          melanoma can lead to vision loss and, according to the Mayo Clinic,
          can lead to complications such as a retinal detachment which also
          results that can also result in vision loss. While ocular melanoma is
          a rare type of cancer, according to the American Academy of
          Ophthalmology, it is the most common eye cancer in adults. It is
          important to book regular eye tests as it may detect if a person has
          ocular melanoma and the eye care professional can proceed with
          treatment accordingly. It is recommended everyone should have an eye
          test with an optometrist at least once every two years, and once a
          year if they are over the age of 65.

            Yes, ocular melanoma can potentially spread to other parts of the
            body. According to the Mayo Clinic, it is possible for ocular
            melanoma to spread (metastasize) outside the eye to other areas of
            the body such as the lungs, bones and most often to the liver. While
            this type of cancer can spread in the body, according to NORD, the
            National Organisation for Rare Disorders, it is extremely rare for
            ocular melanoma to spread to the skin and also rare for skin cancer
            to spread to the eye.

      <p class="para-content">
        The most common treatments for ocular melanoma include eye surgery,
        photocoagulation, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, thermotherapy,
        active surveillance or watchful waiting and immunotherapy. Treating
        cancer, including ocular melanoma, can typically involve different types
        of doctors or specialists in order to combine different treatments for a
        comprehensive treatment plan according to the American Society of
        Oncology. Treatment for ocular melanoma is also determined by the
        location of the melanoma and what stage it is at. The treatments for
        ocular melanoma and their definitions are listed below.
      </p>

      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Eye Surgery:</span>
          Eye surgery can be used to treat ocular melanoma which involves
          removing the melanoma as well as some of the surrounding healthy
          tissue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Photocoagulation:</span>
          Photocoagulation involves using laser light to remove the blood
          vessels that deliver nutrients to the melanoma in order for the
          melanoma cells to die.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Radiation Therapy:</span>
          Radiation therapy uses radiation in either internal or external forms
          to eliminate cancer cells or prevent their growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Targeted Therapy:</span>
          Targeted therapy utilises drugs to target specific features of cancer

          >
          Active surveillance is a type of treatment for ocular melanoma that
          involves actively monitoring a melanoma with regular eye tests and
          checkups, instead of treating it straight away, with the aim of
          avoiding side effects from treatment like radiation. Active
          surveillance is only used on melanoma that is small, slow growing and
          causing no symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Immunotherapy:</span>
          Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that can be used to treat
          ocular melanoma and involves encouraging the immune system to detect
          cancerous cells and kill them.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">1. Eye Surgery</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Eye surgery for ocular melanoma can include different types of
          surgical procedures such as resection, enucleation and exenteration
          according to the National Cancer Institute. Resection involves
          removing the melanoma tumour and a portion of the healthy tissue
          around it. Enucleation may be used if the tumour is too large, has
          reached the optic nerve or vision cannot be retained and involves
          removing the eye and some of the optic nerve. The patient will require
          an artificial eye post-surgery. Exenteration is another type of
          surgery that removes the contents within the eye’s orbital area
          including the eyelid, eye, nerves, fat and muscles. The risks involved
          in performing surgery on the eye can include loss of partial or total
          vision in the operated eye and enucleation and exenteration
          immediately cause total loss of vision.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">2. Photocoagulation</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Photocoagulation is a procedure that involves using laser light to
          remove or shrink the blood vessels that are delivering nutrients to
          the melanoma. Photocoagulation therapy, also known as laser
          photocoagulation, is a non-surgical method of treating cancerous
          melanoma. It has commonly involved krypton laser, xenon-arc laser, and
          argon laser and has been used to treat melanoma tumours that are small
          and are normally found in the posterior choroid according to Abhilasha
          Maheshwari and Paul T. Finger in their article published in the Survey
          of Ophthalmology. The risks associated with this treatment are loss of
          vision, however, this depends on the location and size of the
          melanoma, according to the American Cancer Society.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">3. Radiation Therapy</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Radiation therapy may be used as a treatment for small and
          medium-sized ocular melanomas which involves eliminating cancer cells
          or preventing them from growing. The two types of radiation therapy
          are external and internal radiation. According to the National Cancer
          Institute, external radiation is performed by using a machine to
          target the radiation towards the tumour. This method can prevent the
          radiation from harming the surrounding healthy tissue. Types of
          external radiation therapy include charged-particle external beam
          radiation therapy and gamma knife therapy. Internal radiation therapy
          can involve radioactive plaque therapy and brachytherapy, which may be
          conducted by placing the radioactive material in catheters, seeds,
          wires or needles and are either inserted into or placed near the
          tumour. Immediate side effects of using radiation therapy may include
          causing damage to the eyes which may result in cataracts, retinal
          detachment, blurry vision, increased eye pressure, tear duct issues
          and bleeding in the eye according to the American Cancer Society.
          Radiation therapy has been found to be an effective treatment for 9
          out of 10 melanoma tumours small to medium-sized according to the
          American Cancer Society.

        <p class="para-content">
          Targeted therapy is a treatment used for melanoma tumours on a
          molecular level. Targeted therapy works by interfering with molecules
          that are specifically targeted and consequently stopping the growth of
          cancer cells. The two types of targeted therapy are small-molecule
          drugs and monoclonal antibodies according to the National Cancer
          Institute. The common risks that may be involved with this type of
          treatment for ocular melanoma are floaters, blurry vision, vision
          loss, eye pain and redness according to the National Institutes of
          Health.

          Library of Medicine. It can be used for many different conditions such
          as osteoarthritis and other muscle-related pain. According to the
          Cancer Council, transpupillary thermotherapy is a type of laser
          treatment for ocular melanoma which uses an infrared laser to destroy
          cancer cells through heat.

          Active surveillance, sometimes called watchful waiting, is a type of
          cancer treatment that may be used for those with ocular melanoma who
          have a small tumour that is not growing and are without symptoms.
          Active surveillance involves actively and regularly monitoring and
          testing a melanoma for being a cancerous tumour instead of treating it
          immediately. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, active
          surveillance is used as a way to avoid negative side effects from
          other treatments including radiation therapy.

          Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment used to treat ocular
          melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society, immunotherapy
          works by stimulating a person’s immune system so that it recognises
          the cancer cells and attacks them more effectively. A new type of
          immunotherapy drug that may be used to treat ocular melanoma is called
          KIMMTRAK (tebentafusp), a bispecific fusion protein, which is injected
          into the body via an IV infusion. Side effects of this immunotherapy
          drug include fever, swelling of the skin, skin rash and redness,nausea
          and vomiting. According to an article published by the National Cancer
          Institute in 2021, tebentafusp has improved the survival rate for
          advanced uveal melanoma.
