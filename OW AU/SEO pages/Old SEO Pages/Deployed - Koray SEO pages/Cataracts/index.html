        Cataracts are a type of age-related eye disease that forms in the eye
        lens as a result of clumping protein that has broken down, leading to a
        decline in clear vision. The causes of cataracts are most commonly due
        to age but other causes include trauma to the eye, diabetes and certain
        medications. The cataract symptoms include cloudy or blurred vision,
        double vision in one eye and poor night vision. Other signs of cataracts
        include increased sensitivity to light and frequently changing glasses
        prescriptions. The three main types of cataracts include nuclear,
        cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts. The treatment for a
        cataract is surgery which involves replacing the affected lens with an
        artificial one. Wearing sunglasses can be a form of prevention as they
        may help to delay the onset of early cataracts. Keep reading to find out
        more about the types of cataracts, the symptoms and how they may be
        treated.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What is a Cataract?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        A cataract is a clumping of protein in the eye’s lens which causes the
        lens to become cloudy instead of clear, which is called opacification.
        According to the Mayo Clinic, a cataract typically forms due to age as
        the lens naturally breaks down, but can also be due to trauma to the eye
        such as an injury. An early-stage cataract typically has no symptoms,
        but as the condition progresses, symptoms may include sensitivity to
        lights, poor night vision and blurred and cloudy vision. To summarise,
        the answer to the question of what are cataracts; cataracts are an
        age-related eye condition that causes the lens to look cloudy and can
        affect a person’s vision.
        <br /><br />
        As seen in the image below, a lens with a cataract will appear cloudy as
        opposed to a normal eye which will be clear.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">What Does a Cataract Do to the Eye?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          A cataract causes the lens of the eye to become cloudy, affecting a
          person's vision. According to the Mayo Clinic, advanced cataracts can
          become visible and appears as a cloudy or white film over the eyeball.
          A cataract can cause several symptoms that affect the eyes and vision,
          these include blurred or cloudy vision, sensitivity to light,
          difficulty seeing at night, seeing halos around lights and double
          vision. According to Vision Australia, cataracts are one of the
          leading causes of vision impairment.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">What Part of the Eye Do Cataracts Affect?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          The part of the eye that cataracts affect is the lens which can cause
          it to appear cloudy or white. This is due to the proteins in the eye
          breaking down and clumping together which can affect a person’s
          vision. The lens is a transparent structure and is the part of the eye
          that helps the eye focus light onto the retina. Damage to the lens can
          cause a cataract to form.

      <p class="para-content">
        There are many different types of cataracts that can affect different
        parts of the eye and develop due to different causes. The different
        types of cataracts include cortical cataracts, congenital cataracts,
        nuclear cataracts, secondary cataracts, traumatic cataracts and
        posterior subcapsular cataracts. These types of cataracts and their
        definitions are listed below.

          <span class="list-title">Cortical cataracts:</span>
          Cortical cataracts are a common type of cataract that is characterised
          by opacification of the lens fibres surrounding the centre of the
          lens, known as the nucleus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Congenital cataracts:</span>
          Congenital cataracts are defined as having some presence of cataracts
          at birth. A congenital cataract is a birth defect that affects the
          baby’s ability to see.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Nuclear cataracts:</span>
          Nuclear cataracts affect the centre of the lens, which is called the

          characterised by opacification of the lens fibres surrounding the
          centre of the lens, known as the nucleus. According to the American
          Academy of Ophthalmology, this type of cataract impacts a person’s
          vision depending on how close the opacities on the lens are to the
          centre of the eye, known as the visual axis. The progression of
          cortical cataracts can vary from a few months to over a few years. The
          symptoms of cortical cataracts include seeing glare around lights,
          specifically when driving, a decreased ability to see near and far
          distances and diminished vision contrast sensitivity.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">2. Congenital Cataracts</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Congenital cataracts occur when a baby is born with a degree of
          opacity in their lens. A congenital cataract is a birth defect that
          affects the baby’s ability to see as the light coming into the eye is
          affected by the cloudy part of the lens. It is important for
          congenital cataracts to be treated early as, if left untreated, it can
          lead to vision problems and eventual blindness. There is also an
          increased risk of developing this type of cataracts if there is a
          family history of this eye condition according to Medical News Today.

            cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts. According to the Mayo
            Clinic, nuclear cataracts affect the centre of a patient’s lens
            which is known as the nucleus and as it progresses, it turns the
            lens yellow which clouds their vision leading to issues with
            eyesight. Nuclear cataracts can actually increase a person's near
            vision due to the core of the lens hardening, which may cause people
            who previously had reading glasses to not need them.

            A secondary cataract, also known as posterior capsule opacification,
            occurs due to scar tissue that may develop on a patient’s lens after
            cataract surgery. This complication of cataract surgery is common
            according to the National Eye Institute and can be treated easily.
            Treatment for secondary cataracts is a painless procedure that
            involves a laser making an opening in the cloudy part of the
            patient’s lens. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
            experiencing blurry vision or a decline in clear and sharp vision
            after cataract surgery are signs of secondary cataracts and should
            be assessed by an eye doctor or optometrist.

            Traumatic cataracts describe cataracts caused by eye injuries where
            the lens is damaged. Cataracts due to an eye injury may develop soon
            after the injury or it can occur years later. According to the
            American Academy of Ophthalmology, traumatic cataracts are not only
            caused by penetrating or blunt trauma but they can also be caused by
            radiation, electrocution and chemical burns. The main symptom of a
            traumatic cataract is the clouding of the lens at the site of the
            injury which may spread to the whole lens. According to an article
            published in Science Direct, this type of cataract can be diagnosed
            through an examination of the patient's lens, typically using a slit
            lamp.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What Causes Cataracts to Form?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        The most common cause of cataracts is age as the eye naturally changes
        when a person gets older, which can cause a cataract to form within the
        eye. According to the National Eye Institute, once a person reaches
        around the age of 40, the proteins in the eye’s lens begin to break down
        and subsequently clump together, making the eye become cloudy; this is
        known as a cataract. Other causes of cataracts include being born with
        cataracts, known as congenital cataracts. Trauma to the eye may cause a
        cataract to form due to damage sustained by the lens. People with
        diabetes have an increased risk of developing cataracts. Secondary
        cataracts are a type of cataract that form after cataract surgery due to
        the development of scar tissue as a result of the surgery that can cause
        a person’s vision to become cloudy again. What causes cataracts can be
        due to multiple factors but the most common type is the natural ageing
        process.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What are the Risk Factors of Cataracts?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        The risk of developing cataracts increases with age, however, there are
        other risk factors that may contribute to cataracts forming on a
        person’s eye. The risk factors of cataracts according to the National
        Eye Institute are smoking, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption,
        having a family history of cataracts, taking steroid medication,
        spending long periods in the sun, sustaining an eye injury or having had
        eye surgery. The potential risk factors for cataracts and their
        definitions are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Smoking:</span>
          Smoking can increase a person's risk of cataracts as it can damage the
          proteins in the eye. According to the American Food and Drug
          Administration, smokers are two to three times more likely to develop
          cataracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Diabetes:</span>
          People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing cataracts as
          high blood sugar can lead to changes in the lens which can speed up
          the formation of a cataract.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Alcohol:</span>
          Heavy consumption of alcohol is a risk factor for cataracts as it may
          cause optic nerve damage and nutritional deficiencies, speeding up the
          process of age-related cataracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Family history of cataracts:</span>
          If a person has a family history of cataracts, they are at higher risk
          of developing congenital cataracts. This type of cataract causes the
          eye to be cloudy at birth instead of it developing over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Steroid medications:</span>
          Steroid medications can be used to treat certain health conditions or
          problems such as allergies or arthritis. Steroids may increase a
          person’s risk of cataracts as they can cause a cloudy area to form in
          the lens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">The sun:</span>
          Spending prolonged periods in the sun without proper UV protection in
          the form of sunglasses may increase the risk of a cataract forming on
          the eye.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Eye injuries:</span>
          Eye injuries can lead to the development of a cataract on the lens due
          to the damage it sustains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Eye surgery:</span>
          Eye surgery and especially cataract surgery can cause a cataract to
          form due to the development of scar tissue. Scar tissue as a result of
          eye surgery can cause a person’s vision to become cloudy again. This
          is known as secondary cataracts.

        People may not experience symptoms when they first develop cataracts but
        as the condition progresses, there are multiple symptoms that may occur.
        The possible cataract symptoms include blurred or cloudy vision,
        sensitivity to bright lights, difficulty seeing at night, perceiving
        halos around light sources, colours appearing dull or yellowish, double
        vision and frequent adjusting glasses or contact lenses. The possible

        <p class="para-content">
          Blurred and cloudy vision is a symptom of cataracts as the condition
          interferes with the lens’ ability to focus and receive light,
          resulting in these visual issues. Blurred and cloudy vision are
          similar symptoms that affect a person’s vision and are often caused by
          the same eye condition. However, they are different as blurred vision
          is characterised as being hazy and unclear, whereas cloudy vision
          appears as foggy and like you are looking through a cloud. While
          typically cataracts symptoms can be corrected through prescription
          glasses, this is mostly not the case for cataracts except when in the
          early stages. In later stages the cataract that is affecting a
          person’s vision will only be cured through surgery. A person with
          cataracts vision may experience blurred or cloudy vision due to the
          disruptions to their lens.

        <p class="para-content">
          Sensitivity to bright lights such as headlights and lamps is a common
          symptom of a cataract caused by its formation on the lens. Light
          sensitivity, also known as photophobia, refers to eye pain or
          discomfort when the eyes are exposed to light, which often causes
          people to squint. If you have heightened sensitivity to light, it is
          important to seek medical care. Sensitivity to bright lights in the
          context of cataracts vision occurs due to the eye’s lens not being
          clear, causing light that enters the eye to scatter. This also causes
          other vision problems such as blurred and cloudy vision.

        <p class="para-content">
          People with a cataract may have difficulty seeing at night or in dimly
          lit areas. This difficulty is caused by the eyes taking a long time to
          adjust when transitioning from light to dark. Having poor night vision
          can affect a person when driving or in the cinema. Driving at night
          with cataracts vision is also difficult due to the glare seen around
          headlights and other sources of light as well as a sensitivity to
          light. If you struggle with seeing at night or in low-light areas, it
          is advisable to seek an assessment from a healthcare or eye care
          professional.

        <p class="para-content">
          A person with a cataract may perceive halos and glare around light
          sources. Halos are most commonly noticed in a low-light room or at
          night. A halo around lights is described as colourful and bright
          circles and can significantly impact a person’s vision, especially
          when driving at night. Perceiving halos around lights is a common
          symptom of cataracts and is caused due to the lens becoming cloudy due
          to clumping protein which causes light to scatter as it enters the
          eye, leading to halos. Cataracts vision is often associated with halos
          and other impacts to light such as a sensitivity to bright light.

          is passing through the cataract which may dull the colours or make
          things appear yellowish. Some describe cataracts vision as seeing
          faded colours and a discolouration of certain colours. According to a
          study published in the National Library of Medicine, age-related
          cataracts have a major impact on a patient’s colour vision. The study
          defines colour perception as light transmittance via the optical
          system, including the lens, cornea and pupil. Another way colour is
          affected by cataracts is there is a reduction in contrast in retinal
          images.

          Double vision, also known as diplopia, may occur in one eye due to a
          cataract formation on the lens, disrupting vision. Double vision
          occurs when light does not hit both of the retinas at the same point,
          causing the eyes to see two distinct or overlapping images. There are
          three different types of double vision, the first is horizontal which
          occurs when two images are side by side or overlap. The next is
          vertical which occurs when two images appear as one higher or lower
          than the other. Finally, monocular is double vision that occurs even
          when one eye is shut, which is the type caused by cataracts. A person
          with cataracts vision may experience monocular double vision as a
          result of lens disruption.

          A person with cataracts vision may frequently adjust their glasses or
          contact lens prescription as the cataract is interfering with their
          vision. A cataract can change the eye’s focusing power, which can make
          a person’s vision blurry and make it difficult to see objects clearly,
          prompting them to get a new, stronger prescription for their lenses.
          According to the Mayo Clinic, in the early stages of a cataract,
          glasses may help a person’s vision although as it progresses, a
          glasses prescription will not help correct vision problems; surgery is
          the only option.

      <p class="para-content">
        Cataracts are diagnosed by an optometrist or other eye care professional
        during an eye test. According to the Mayo Clinic, there are four main
        tests used to diagnose a cataract. These tests include a visual acuity
        test, a slit-lamp exam and a retinal exam. A visual acuity test will be
        performed to test if the patient's vision is impaired. This test
        involves reading letters off a chart which will determine the clarity
        and sharpness of a patient’s eyesight. A slit-lamp exam allows the eye
        care professional to look at the structures in the eye including the
        lens, cornea and iris. A retinal exam involves dilating the patient’s
        eyes so the optometrist can look at the back of the eyes to look for
        signs of a cataract.

          The most commonly diagnosed form of cataracts is age-related cataracts
          which include nuclear, cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts.
          According to Medibank Australia, more than 700,000 people in Australia
          are affected by cataracts. Age-related cataracts occur due to the
          natural ageing process and a person’s risk for this type of cataracts
          can be increased if they smoke, drink excessively, have diabetes and
          have a family history of cataracts. Age-related cataracts can be
          diagnosed through an eye test performed by an optometrist. Tests for
          age-related cataracts may include a slit lamp test and a visual acuity
          test.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">How can Cataracts Cause Blindness?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          According to HealthDirect, cataracts cause blindness as the proteins
          that clump together on the lens block the amount of light that can
          pass through to the retina, leading to loss of vision and without
          treatment, eventual blindness. There is no specific time frame for how
          long before cataracts cause blindness as it can be different depending
          on the person and type of cataracts. In some cases it can take years
          and in others months. It is important to have your eyes checked by an
          optometrist if you suspect you have cataracts or have been diagnosed
          with this condition as they can monitor its progression and recommend
          treatment.

            Although vision loss caused by cataracts may be reversed through
            cataract surgery, this is not the case for glaucoma. According to
            the Glaucoma Associates of Texas, the eye condition glaucoma does
            not cause cataracts but these two conditions can occur at the same
            time due to the risk of these conditions increasing as you get

      <p class="para-content">
        The most common treatment for cataracts is cataract surgery. Cataract
        surgery is a very common surgery that is performed to restore a person’s
        vision that has been affected by cataracts. According to Better Health
        Victoria, cataracts are treated by removing the cloudy lens of the eye
        through surgery. Once the lens is removed, it is then replaced with a
        plastic, artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens which stays there
        permanently. This cataracts treatment is performed by an ophthalmologist
        and, according to the Mayo Clinic, the procedure typically takes an hour
        or under. Recovery from cataract surgery can typically take a few days
        and the progress will be monitored by an eye doctor with a full recovery
        often taking eight weeks.
        <br /><br />
        According to Vision Australia, if cataract surgery is not an option, low
        vision aids can be used as well as advice and information provided by an
        eye care professional may help the management of this eye condition.

        There are certain lifestyle changes and actions a person can take to
        potentially avoid cataracts or slow their progression. The ways to
        potentially avoid cataracts include wearing sunglasses, quitting
        smoking, having regular eye tests and managing diabetes if you have this
        medical condition. These suggestions on how to avoid cataracts and their

      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Wear sunglasses:</span>
          Wearing sunglasses can help to protect the eyes from the harmful rays
          emitted by the sun. This can help avoid cataracts as spending
          prolonged periods in the sun without proper UV protection can increase
          a person’s risk of a cataract forming on the eye.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Quit smoking:</span>
          Smoking causes many adverse effects on the whole body, including the
          eyes. It increases a person’s risk of developing cataracts as it can
          damage the proteins in the eye. Therefore, to lower the risk of a
          cataract forming on the eye, people should quit smoking.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Have regular eye tests:</span>
          Having a regular eye test can ensure your optometrist can monitor your
          vision for changes and detect certain eye diseases, including
          cataracts. It is recommended that you have an eye test at least once
          every two years.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Manage diabetes:</span>
          People who have diabetes have a higher risk of developing cataracts.
          This is due to high blood sugar leading to changes in the lens, which
          can speed up the formation of a cataract. Therefore, people should aim
          to adequately manage their diabetes.
