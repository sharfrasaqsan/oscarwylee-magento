      Blue Light Glasses: Definition, Use, Types and Benefits
    </h1>
    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content mobile-para-margin">
        Blue light glasses have lenses designed to block or reduce the blue
        light emitted from digital screens according to the Cleveland Clinic.
        The use of blue light lenses, also referred to as screen glasses is
        intended for protection against the potentially harmful effects that
        prolonged exposure to blue light is believed to have. The benefits of
        blue light glasses, according to Everyday Health and Harvard Business
        Review, are better sleep quality and quantity as well as better work
        performance. There are different types of blue light glasses, such as
        red, orange and yellow tinted lenses. The debate of, do blue light
        glasses really work or if it is beneficial to use blue light glasses for
        the computer, is still ongoing. However, as evidence shows, results are
        often too inconsistent to reach a conclusion according to the National
        Library of Medicine.

      <p class="para-content">
        Blue light glasses have lenses that are made to help block or reduce the
        blue light that digital screens emit. The blue light from digital
        screens is believed to have effects that may be harmful to the eyes.
        These harmful effects may include eye strain, dry eyes, blurry vision
        and headaches. However, these are likely symptoms of digital eye strain
        and dry eye according to Amy Sheppard and James Wolffsohn in a paper
        published in the National Library of Medicine. The question of what are
        blue light glasses is common, especially in regard to whether it is
        necessary during screen time. According to Optometry Australia’s 2022
        Vision Index, increased screen time as a result of hybrid working has
        seen a progression in eye problems in Australians.

        <h3 class="sub-div-title">How Do Blue Light Glasses Work?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Blue light glasses work by lessening the amount of blue light that
          enters the eye. The lenses of blue light glasses are coated with a
          filter or built with special material in the lens. The answers to what
          is a blue light filter and what do blue light glasses do are
          essentially connected. The special lens coating on blue light glasses
          acts as the blue light filter and as a result, either absorbs or
          reflects the blue light. Blue light has a short wavelength in the
          visible spectrum, according to Zhi-Chun Zhao, Ying Zhou, Gang Tan and
          Juan Li in their paper published in the International Journal of
          Ophthalmology. The short wavelength of blue light means a higher
          amount of energy and as a result, is often perceived to be harmful
          passing through the cornea of the eye.

      <p class="para-content">
        The use of blue light glasses, also known as screen glasses, can be used
        when working from a digital device as well as during recreational screen
        time. Blue light can come from laptops, computers, smartphones, tablets,
        gaming consoles, and LED screens. Individuals may be interested in using
        blue light glasses when watching television, streaming videos on a
        tablet/laptop or browsing the internet.
      </p>

      <div class="sub-div">
        <h3 class="sub-div-title">Who Uses Blue Light Glasses?</h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          Individuals who work with digital devices or those who may be
          experiencing discomfort in their eyes may choose to use blue light
          glasses. Eye problems such as digital eye strain and dry eyes are
          common when using digital devices for long periods. People with
          digital eye strain or dry eyes may associate their symptoms with their
          exposure to blue light. Individuals who spend their spare time on
          digital devices may also want to use blue light glasses for
          protection. Although there is not enough evidence to conclude whether
          blue light is harmful, it has been common for people to be more wary
          of the possible effects of blue light on their eyes, according to
          Zhi-Chun Zhao, Ying Zhou, Gang Tan and Juan Li in their paper
          published in the International Journal of Ophthalmology. It is a
          widely available option for people with prescription glasses and those
          who do not require prescription glasses. With the increased time spent
          on digital devices for work and entertainment, it is common for people
          to resort to blue glasses for the computer.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What Are the Benefits of Blue Light Glasses?</h2>
      <p class="para-content">
        The benefits of blue light glasses are improved sleep quality and
        quantity as well as work performance as suggested by evidence from a
        number of studies. Blue light glasses’ benefits may differ between
        individuals or may not occur at all. It is important to note that there
        is not enough evidence to support whether blue light is harmful.
        Therefore, blue light glasses are not recommended by the American
        Academy of Ophthalmology. The benefits of blue light glasses are listed
        below.
      </p>

      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Improved sleep quality and quantity:</span>
          Improved sleep quality and quantity may be achieved using blue light
          glasses as studies have shown. Blue light from digital screens during
          the evening can cause disruptions to our melatonin production.
          Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the body to help us feel
          sleepy when it is dark at night. Blue light glasses can minimise how
          much blue light we are taking in during evening screen time. Blue
          light assists us with feeling alert during the day with the sun
          contributing as the biggest source of blue light. Consequently,
          experiencing blue light from digital devices near sleeping hours can
          cause excessive stimulation to the brain and hinder the secretion of
          melatonin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Improved Work Performance:</span>
          Improved work performance has been a suggested outcome through the use
          of blue light glasses in a study done by Guarana, C. L., Barnes, C.
          and Ong, W. on the effects of blue light filtration on sleep and work
          outcomes. The result of improved sleep quality has an overall positive
          influence on work performance, task engagement and work behaviour.

          What are the Limitations of Blue Light Glasses?
        </h3>
        <p class="para-content">
          The limitations of blue light glasses are their efficacy in preventing
          symptoms of digital eye strain, dry eyes, long-term damage from blue
          light and the effects of blue light. While there are few studies that
          exhibit the effectiveness of blue light glasses on sleep and work
          improvement, the limitations also extend to whether blue light is
          conclusively harmful to the eyes. The limitations of blue light
          glasses are listed below.
        </p>

        <ol class="ordered-list">

            <span class="list-title"
              >Preventing digital eye strain and dry eye symptoms:</span
            >
            Blue light glasses have no effect in preventing symptoms such as eye
            strain, headaches, blurry vision or dry eyes. According to the
            American Academy of Ophthalmology, the damaging effects of blue
            light are still under investigation. Therefore, symptoms that occur
            during excessive use of digital devices are likely caused by eye
            problems such as digital eye strain and dry eyes. These eye problems
            can develop from extended screen time and reduced blinking as
            opposed to the blue light.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Preventing long-term damage:</span>
            Blue light glasses may not be useful in altering any long-term
            negative effects of prolonged screen time. It is strongly advised to
            take regular breaks while working with digital devices, use
            artificial tears to ensure your eyes are hydrated and actively
            remember to blink more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="list-title">Harmful effects of blue light:</span>
            The effects of blue light have not been confirmed to be damaging to
            the eyes. The duration of our screen time may likely be the cause of
            discomfort according to the Cleveland Clinic.

        The types of blue light glasses are red, orange and yellow tinted. Blue
        light glasses with red or orange-tinted lenses are designed to block
        more blue light according to the Sleep Foundation. They may change the
        colour of your digital device screen. Yellow-tinted glasses are intended
        to block a narrow spectrum of blue light, this may be a suitable option
        for daytime use. Oscar Wylee offers the option to add a blue light
        filter to your prescription glasses. You can read more information in
        our article about different types of glasses. Blue light glasses for the
        elderly and for those with diagnosed eye conditions will only differ

            Yes, some display devices have blue light features which may reduce
            the blue light that is emitted from the screens. For example, Apple
            has a function on their iPhones called Night Shift which
            automatically changes the colours on the display to a warmer hue
            which can help the owner get a better night’s sleep. Android phones
            have a similar function known as an Eye Comfort Shield which adjusts
            the screen’s colours based on the time of day. This can also be done
            manually so you can choose when to turn on the blue light features.
            You can find a detailed article on how to turn off blue light on my

          <h4 class="sub-div-title">Do Blue Light Glasses Work?</h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            It is difficult to give an answer to do blue light glasses work as
            the research is still in its early stages. While a blue light lens
            is effective at blocking blue light, there is no definitive evidence
            that these types of glasses will protect the eyes from damage. While
            the effects of blue light are still being discovered, there is
            evidence that suggests blue light has a negative effect on sleep.
            According to a study published in The Proceedings of the National
            Academy of Sciences, blue light may cause people to release less
            melatonin which is the chemical that aids in sleep. A blue light
            filter has also been suggested to help with the eye condition called
            digital eye strain which is caused by prolonged use of digital
            screens. Therefore, wearing blue light glasses for computer use can
            be beneficial.

            Can Blue Light Glasses Help with Eye Strain?
          </h4>
          <p class="para-content">
            As discussed, blue light glasses can be used to potentially help
            with eye strain, specifically digital eye strain. Digital eye
            strain, also known as computer vision syndrome, is a term used to
            encompass a wide range of vision and eye symptoms experienced as a
            result of prolonged use of digital screens such as computers, phones
            and tablets. Digital eye strain can cause the eyes to feel fatigued,
            cause blurry vision and also dry eyes. A blue light lens is among
            the possible treatments for digital eye strain alongside taking
            frequent breaks from computer use, using lubricating eye drops,
            wearing prescription glasses and adjusting the brightness of the
            screen. If you suffer from eye strain caused by looking at a digital
            screen, you may benefit from wearing blue light glasses for computer
            use. You can find more helpful advice in our article on the 10 tips
