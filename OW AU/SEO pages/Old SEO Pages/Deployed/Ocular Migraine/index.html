          <h1>Ocular Migraine: Definitions, Causes, Symptoms, Treatments</h1>
          <p>
            An ocular migraine is an umbrella term for different types of
            migraines that involve vision loss and pain, real or perceived,
            around the eyes or painless spots or blackouts that occur to your
            vision.
          </p>

        <div class="textMainNobg">
          <h2>What is an ocular migraine?</h2>
          <p>
            An ocular migraine, also known as a retinal migraine, is a term for
            a painful or inflamed sensation around the eyes and brain. There is
            no official diagnosis and no condition exactly and precisely called
            an ‘ocular migraine’. The word refers to many sensations with a
            similar feeling.
          </p>

          <h3>Migraine with aura</h3>
          <p>
            The closest diagnosis an optometrist may give for a migraine
            connected to retinal issues is a ‘migraine with aura’. This migraine
            is described as a headache that happens before, or during, a time
            when a patient sees light flashes, sudden blind spots or other
            feelings around the head. <br /><br />
            It is also possible that the visual sensations of flashes of light
            or a quick moment of blindness occur without any headache or pain
            associated with them. This type of migraine is referred to as a
            ‘visual aura’ and they commonly appear as painless flashes of jagged
            lightning.
          </p>

          <h3>How is an ocular migraine diagnosed?</h3>
          <p>
            At Oscar Wylee, ocular migraines are diagnosed through multiple
            methods. One of the first priorities an optometrist will have when
            examining a patient for an ocular migraine is ensuring there are no
            neurological issues causing them. The symptoms of an ocular migraine
            are very similar to the symptoms of more alarming conditions. To
            ensure that a migraine with aura isn’t something more serious, such
            as a tumour, stroke or a deep retinal issue, the eye health
            specialist will typically perform a neurological visual field test
            in addition to any other tests.

          <h2>Treating an ocular migraine</h2>
          <p>
            Ocular migraines are often treated on a person by person basis. As
            the cause of the migraine is linked to the individual, the treatment
            of the migraine can change as well. Stress and lifestyle changes are
            the most common treatments for the root causes of an ocular
            migraine. For the immediate symptoms, medication such as aspirin or
            pain killers can help ease the immediate symptoms. Beta-blockers
            have shown some effectiveness in reducing the symptoms of ocular
            migraines, however this is not the medications intended purpose and
            should not be used without a specialist’s consultation.
            Additionally, each of these treatments may not affect the cause of
            the migraine, and must be recommended by a GP or other health
            professional.
            <br /><br />
            If there is a chance the migraine is caused by stress or eye strain,
            an optometrist at Oscar Wylee may recommend a blue light filter for
            your glasses to reduce the bright light and eye strain that may be
            causing the migraine.

          <h2>Is an ocular migraine dangerous?</h2>
          <p>
            PThere is no type of ocular migraine that will be lethal or
            dangerous to your health. Ocular migraines are variable depending on
            the individual in causes and symptoms. This makes it difficult to
            determine if the symptoms are part of a neurological condition or
            can be treated as a regular migraine with aura.
          </p>

          <h3 class="topMargin">Do ocular migraines lead to a stroke?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            There is little to no relation between an ocular migraine and a
            stroke. As a condition where it can be difficult to differentiate
            whether the migraine is originating from the head or the eyes, it
            can be very worrying for a patient to have a migraine with aura, due
            to other, much more severe conditions having similar symptoms.
            <br /><br />
            To understand if a sensation is a stroke instead of an ocular
            migraine, use the American Stroke Associations F.A.S.T. system.
            F.A.S.T will help identify the early warning of a stroke before or
            as they are felt. It stands for:
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              <b>Face</b>: If there are issues such as numbness or tingling on a
              single side of the face
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Arm</b>: If one of both arms are numb and can’t be lifted
            </li>
            <li><b>Speech</b>: If speech is jumbled or slurred</li>
            <li>
              <b>Time</b>: All these symptoms together must be treated with
              utmost caution. Do not delay in seeking help
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="minusPadding">
            If you are regularly suffering from symptoms of a migraine and
            unfamiliar sensations begin appearing, consult an expert as soon as
            possible.
