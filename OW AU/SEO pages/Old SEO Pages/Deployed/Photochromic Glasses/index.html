          <h2>What Are Photochromic Lenses?</h2>
          <p>
            Photochromic lenses, also known as transition lenses or adaptive
            lenses, are a type of prescription glasses that darken in response
            to contact with ultraviolet rays from the sun. This darkening will
            even happen on cloudy or rainy days, as the reaction is still
            active.
            <br /><br />
            William H. Armistead and Stanley Donald Stookey invented the lenses
            in 1964, but they only saw public use in 1991, with the founding of
            Transitions Optical.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Are They Called Transition Lenses?</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest creator and supplier of photochromic lenses is a United
            States-based company known as Transitions Optical. This company,
            founded in 1990, is the world’s largest mass producer of
            photochromic lenses. Because of this, in many parts of the world,
            they are known by the company’s name for the product.

          <h2>Photochromic Lenses with Oscar Wylee</h2>
          <p>
            Oscar Wylee can apply photochromic lens options with the use of spin
            technology: A liquid form of the photochromic effect is applied to
            the glasses before it is spun with a device that then applies the
            coating smoothly across the entire surface.
            <br /><br />
            Oscar Wylee also offers Transitions Gen 8 lens enhancement. This
            form of coating application costs more than spin technology but also
            has added benefits, such as a coating that won’t scratch off, as
            well as improved performance and longer lasting performance.

          <h2>How Do Photochromic Lenses Work?</h2>
          <p>
            Photochromic lenses have a chemical coating in the lens. This
            chemical is called silver halide, also known as silver chloride.
            This same material was once used in photographic paper and films. It
            is a highly UV sensitive substance that shifts shape inside the
            frame’s lenses in response to the sun’s rays. This causes the lens
            to darken in response to direct sunlight. The more rays there are,
            the darker they will become.

                For a home cleaning, there are many things you can do to get the
                most shelf life possible out of your adaptive lens:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Always clean your lenses at least once a day.</li>
                <li>
                  Use an optical, microfiber or lens cloth to clean them once a
                  day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apply a small drop of dishwasher liquid to your fingers, wet
                  the lens, then use your fingertips to spread the liquid. This
                  is a suitable method for wiping off any fingerprints or oil
                  smudges. Wash them with lukewarm water after cleaning liquid
                  is used.

            There is also an added advantage of using photochromic lenses. You
            not only reduce damage done by UV rays, but you also don’t have to
            sacrifice your corrective prescription or keep a separate pair of
            prescription sunglasses for outdoor usage.

            How Do I Know If My Glasses are Photochromic?
          </h2>
          <p>
            There is a straightforward test that can be done if you are unsure
            if your glasses are photochromic. Simply take the pair you are
            unsure about and cover them with your hand on a bright day. If they
            are photochromic, the lens will darken in response to the bright
            light.
          </p>

          <h2 class="topMargin">Can You Wear Photochromic Lenses at Night?</h2>
          <p>
            As adaptive lenses mainly react to UV rays, they will rarely darken
            at night, and when they do, it will not be to the extent of daytime
            rays. This makes them a safe choice of eyewear for driving at night.
            <br /><br />
            However, photochromic lenses will not react to, or aid with glares
            from artificial sources like headlamps or streetlights, nor will it
            make any notable difference against bright or disruptive
            reflections. For functional night driving, it is recommended that
            you wear a pair of clear prescription or non-prescription glasses
            (link to be added) with anti-glare coating.
          </p>

          <h2>What Are The Disadvantages Of Photochromic Lenses?</h2>
          <p>
            Your photochromic lenses may go darker even on a cloudy day, as it
            is not reacting to light but to UV rays. Depending on your
            activities when you wear them, this may be an annoyance or a
            disadvantage. It should also be noted that not all photochromic
            lenses are polarised, meaning they may not have the desired level of
            glare blocking at all times.
            <br /><br />
            As carshield windows use the same darkening technique as these
            lenses, there may sometimes be a clash or redundancy while driving
            with transition lenses on during the daytime. Photochromic lenses
            may also need around 30 seconds to adjust to the lighting in order
            to gain their full effect.

          <h2>How Long Do Photochromic Lenses Last?</h2>
          <p>
            The wear out date of transition lenses depends on a variety of
            factors, including care and temperature. A pair that is wearing out
            may begin taking on a yellow tint, and the darkening effect will
            become less functional.
            <br /><br />
            A good pair of photochromic lenses should typically last for 3
            years. With proper care and maintenance, a lifespan of 5 years or
            more is also possible.
