          <p>
            High index lenses are a type of optical lens that you can choose to
            have for your glasses. They are lighter and thinner than a standard
            glasses lens and have many benefits, especially for those with a
            higher prescription.
            <br /><br />
            We have a range of high index lenses available at Oscar Wylee. Keep
            reading to find out more on these lenses and how to pick the ones
            that are right for you.

          <h2>The Lens Index</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            To fully comprehend what a high index lens is, it is best to first
            gain some understanding of what we mean by lens index. A lens index
            is a group of numbers or values that refers to the ability of a lens
            to refract light. As light passes through a lens, the lens will
            refract or bend this light, allowing your eyes to focus clearly.
            <br /><br />
            Generally, the higher the lens index value, the thinner and lighter
            a lens will be. At Oscar Wylee we provide several indexes for your
            lenses. The prescription recommendations and lens thicknesses in
            this article are a general guide. It is advised that you talk to an
            optometrist or our in-store dispensing staff before buying high
            index lenses. <br /><br />
            High index lenses are available for most lens types, including
            single vision lenses, bifocal lenses and multifocal lenses, also
            known as

          <h2>The difference between normal lenses and high index lenses.</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The difference between normal optical lenses and high index lenses
            lie in how they are made and how they refract light. Normal lenses,
            those that sit in the standard range, are often made with plastic
            and will refract light to help correct vision issues such as
            nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia) and
            astigmatism.
            <br /><br />
            High index lenses work in the same way. However, they are made with
            a different type of material, often a special, more dense, plastic,
            that refracts light more efficiently. This means they do not need as
            much material to do the same job as normal optical lenses.
          </p>

          <span class="smallText">Source: Optometrists Network </span>

          <h3>Polycarbonate lenses vs high index lenses</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Polycarbonate is a type of strong, high impact resistant plastic
            that can be used as a glasses lens. Due to their durability,
            polycarbonate lenses are often used in children’s glasses, for those
            who play sports, or engage in other activities where glasses may be
            prone to breakage.
            <br /><br />
            Polycarbonate is generally not used for high index lenses as,
            although they are impact resistant and durable, they do not provide
            as much visual clarity as other materials.
          </p>

          <h3>Are all high index lenses aspheric?</h3>
          <p>
            When talking about lenses, the term aspheric refers to the profile
            of the lens, whereas high index refers generally to the thickness.
            An aspheric lens will have a flatter profile than normal optical
            lenses, or, in other words, they will not be as spherical. Aspheric
            lenses will help to reduce eye distortion.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, our high index lenses are also aspheric. Together, a
            lens that is both high index and aspheric will be thinner and
            flatter, often more aesthetically pleasing and more comfortable for
            those with a stronger prescription.

          <h2>The advantages of high index lenses</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            When it comes to choosing a high index lens for your glasses, it is
            good to know what the advantages are, especially compared to normal
            optical lenses. The advantages include the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Lighter and thinner - </b>High index lenses are lighter and
              thinner than normal optical glasses, making for a more comfortable
              wear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Clearer, sharper vision - </b>Light has less area to travel
              through with a high index lens, meaning less distortion and
              clearer vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Aesthetics - </b>High index lenses reduce the magnification and
              minification of the eyes, meaning you won’t have that bug eyed
              look some thicker, stronger lenses can produce.

          <h2>Disadvantages of high index lenses</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Whilst high index lenses may have advantages, especially for those
            with a high prescription, they also have disadvantages, including
            the following.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>They can be scratch prone.</li>
            <li>High index lenses may be more expensive than normal lenses.</li>
            <li>They may also be brittle and more prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>
              High index lenses can be more reflective of light, which may make
              them harder to use during brightly lit work.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How much do high index lenses cost?</h2>
          <p>
            As high index lenses are made with a special material, they often
            have a higher cost than normal optical lenses. At Oscar Wylee, our
            high index lenses are priced individually, according to thickness.
            <br /><br />
            You can pick which index you would like when ordering your glasses
            online or you can come into your nearest Oscar Wylee store and our

            you.
