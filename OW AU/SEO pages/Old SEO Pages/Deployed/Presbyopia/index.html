          <h1>Presbyopia - Meaning, Symptoms, Treatment</h1>
          <p>
            Presbyopia is a natural biological change that causes the eyes to
            lose their ability to focus with age. It is one of the most common
            eye conditions and will likely affect a majority of people in their
            lifetime.

          <h2>What is Presbyopia?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Presbyopia is the medical term for when the eyes lose the ability to
            focus on close objects. It is a type of refractive error and is a
            natural part of aging for a large majority of people. Presbyopia
            literally means ‘old eye’ and is one of the most common eye
            conditions in the world.
            <br /><br />According to the
            <a
              href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/eye-health/vision-problems-in-older-australians/summary"
              class="linkTo"
              >Australian institute of health and welfare</a
            >, over 1.3 million Australian seniors have self-reported as having
            presbyopia. While presbyopia is a natural part of aging, the
            symptoms and effects of other conditions are often accidentally
            prescribed to presbyopia instead, due to many other conditions, such
            as age related macular degeneration, also having symptoms shown as a
            result of the eyes naturally aging.

          <h2>What causes presbyopia?</h2>
          <p>
            Presbyopia is caused by the lens in the eyes becoming harder and
            losing their flexibility as the eyes age. Because the lens is less
            flexible, the eye don’t change shape to allow for greater levels of
            focus. As age-related farsightedness increases, aging eyes may reach
            a point where they cannot focus on near objects without the help of
            corrective glasses.

          <h2>What age does presbyopia start?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            If the following common signs of presbyopia are showing, then it is
            advisable to book a comprehensive eye test with a qualified
            optometrist:
          </p>

          <ol class="minusPadding">
            <li>You struggle to see things up close</li>
            <li>You hold materials far away from you in order to read them</li>
            <li>Your vision is blurring at your normal reading distance</li>
            <li>Eye strain</li>
            <li>
              You have headaches or feel eye strain after you’re done reading
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="minusPadding">
            Symptoms of presbyopia are most commonly noticed after the age of
            40, but earlier signs of the symptoms are not unheard of. The aging
            process of your eyes will continue after you’ve first noticed it
            until approximately 65 years of age, when the condition may begin
            the process of stabilization.

          <h3 class="addTopMargin">Early presbyopia:</h3>
          <p>
            Although most commonly noticeable at the age of 40, symptoms of
            presbyopia can begin showing as early as age 35. There may be a
            higher chance of premature presbyopia if certain health conditions
            such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease are already pre-existing,
            if the patient regularly take medication like antidepressants or if
            a patient has a preexisting condition of farsightedness or
            nearsightedness.
            <br /><br />
            Early Symptoms of presbyopia are more noticeable in a profession or
            lifestyle that requires a heavy amount of up-close sight, such as an
            accountant or graphic designer. This does not mean that the
            profession has increased the risk of presbyopia.

              <p class="minusPadding">
                There are 5 stages of presbyopia that most commonly occur as the

                  The eyes can no longer read or see up close without the use of
                  corrective aid at all

          <h3>Presbyopia vs myopia</h3>
          <p>
            Myopia is a common eye condition that causes objects in the distance
            to appear blurry. Like Presbyopia, it is a refractive error. The
            symptoms of each type of refractive error, such as hyperopia or
            astigmatism, may be attributed to the wrong condition if a
            professional eye care specialist expertise is not sought.
            <br /><br />
            It is possible to have presbyopia and myopia at the same time. This
            also applies to any other refraction and sight related eye
            conditions. The causes and symptoms of age-related eye conditions
            are typically separated from other conditions, which can still occur
            in a person with presbyopia.

          <h2>Treating presbyopia</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Presbyopia symptoms can be treated with corrective prescriptions.
            After an optometrist has given an official diagnosis, they will
            typically prescribe a pair of glasses. Reading glasses are the most
            common type of treatment of presbyopia. They may also include
            multifocal lenses in the prescription, as the lenses may also be
            capable of correcting any other vision conditions that are
            applicable. <br /><br />
            Please be advised, a glasses prescription for presbyopia is given to
            relieve or aid the symptoms of the condition; They will not improve
            the eyes. They will also not correct or fix the issues of the
            hardened lenses
          </p>

          <h3 class="topMargin">Vuity Eye Drops:</h3>
          <p>
            An eye drop treatment named Vuity is sometimes prescribed to treat
            presbyopia in the United States. Vuity drops do not affect the
            symptoms or causes of presbyopia. Instead, the drop decreases the
            size of the pupil. This increases the depth of focus and can help
            make reading easier. <br /><br />
            Currently, this treatment is not available in Australia or Oscar
            Wylee, as it is not approved by the TGA. No other conclusively
            proven medical treatments for presbyopia are available at this time.

          <h2>Can laser surgery correct presbyopia?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Laser surgery treatment for presbyopia is currently still in
            development. There is no procedure available to fix the lens
            hardening due to age. Corrective surgery for presbyopia and
            presbyopia alone has yet to occur, it so far has been a correction
            of other eye health conditions first and foremost. LASIK or PRK
            treatments are typically only recommended for patients who already
            have other eye refractions issues as well. <br /><br />
            Be aware that Oscar Wylee does not offer laser treatments of any
            form.
