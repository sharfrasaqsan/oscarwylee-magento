          <h2>What are aviator sunglasses?</h2>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            Aviator sunglasses are a type of sunglasses, dating back to the
            1930s. First created for US pilots to protect their eyes in the air,
            aviator sunglasses emphasise functionality. Their tear-drop lenses
            and wide facial and eye coverage, aim to block out as much sunlight
            and glare as possible.
            <br /><br />
            Aviator sunglasses have also been an iconic long lasting fashion
            trend, embodying a certain swagger and cool vibe. Aviator sunglasses
            have been popularised by pop culture icons such as Freddie Mercury,
            Stevie Nicks and Lenny Kravitz. Today, aviator style sunglasses
            remain a fashion staple for many.
            <br /><br />
            Aviator sunglasses were originally designed with a green lens and
            plastic frame, then later a metal frame. Here at Oscar Wylee, we use
            a range of quality materials to make our aviator sunglasses, from
            stainless steel, to a plant-based plastic. Visit one of our stores
            or browse online, and you will find a variety of aviator sunglasses,
            catering to your individual eye needs and design preferences.

          <h3 class="addMarginTop">Why are they called aviator sunglasses?</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            The first aviator style sunglasses were invented to protect a
            pilot’s eyes whilst flying- hence the name aviator. In the 1930s, US
            pilots were flying to new, impressive heights. With this advancement
            however, came trouble with headaches, nausea and glare. The US eye
            health firm Bausch & Lomb, created aviator sunglasses to combat
            these issues. The design of the sunglasses resembles pilot’s
            goggles, with the lense covering as much as the eye and surrounding
            area as possible. This allows the sunglasses to give the wearer high
            protection from sunlight and glare.

            The popularity of the classic aviator sunglasses style
          </h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            In 1937, a year after being created for military use, aviator
            sunglasses were released to the public. According to the BBC,
            military wear was hugely influential on fashion trends in the 30s,
            and the potential of these sunglasses as a fashion accessory became
            quickly apparent.

          <p>
            In the proceeding years, aviator sunglasses were popularised by many
            influential stars including Elvis Presley, Freddie Mercury and Tom
            Cruise in Top Gun. Today the glasses remain popular, often seen on
            high profile runways and in fashion magazines. Their fashion-forward
            yet practical design have also made them a popular street-wear
            staple.

            The aviator sunglasses design has also carried over into general
            corrective glasses. At Oscar Wylee you can shop the frames for your

          <h2>Are aviator sunglasses unisex?</h2>
          <p class="addPaddingBottom">
            Aviator sunglasses are a unisex product, suitable for women and men.
            Though they may have a more masculine-orientated origin, many famous
            women such as Stevie Nicks, Gloria Steinem and more recently
            Jennifer Lopez, have popularised the aviator design for women.
            Genderfluid fashion icons such as David Bowie have also worn them,
            showing that aviator sunglasses are perfect for any gender.
          </p>

          <h2>What face shape suits aviator sunglasses?</h2>
          <p>
            Aviator sunglasses are traditionally more suitable for oval or
            triangular face shapes. However, with a variety of designs
            available, you may find something that suits you outside of these
            face shapes. Here at Oscar Wylee, we have several aviator
            sunglasses, ranging in colour and shape, for you to choose from.
            <br /><br />
            Due to the shape of the aviator bridge and positioning of the nose
            pads, these sunglasses are usually not well suited to those with a
            low bridge.

          <h2>How to clean aviator sunglasses</h2>
          <p>
            The cleaning process for your aviator sunglasses will be the same as
            it would be for any other pair of glasses. Use lens spray and a
            microfibre cloth to clean your sunglasses lenses, gently removing
            any smudge marks. You can use our lens spray available in store.
            <br /><br />
            It is not recommended to use your breath or clothes to clean glasses
            as this may be abrasive and scratch the lens.
            <br /><br />
