              I was served by Andree who spent extra time and effort to ensure

              I was very happy with the service at Oscar Wylee Victoria Gardens.
              Both the optometrist and the sales girls were most helpful
              especially when choosing frames. They were very patient in helping
              me decide what suited me the most.

          <ul class="store-ul">
            <li>
              <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser will
              conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
              will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist
              with measuring pressure in the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>A Digital Photograph:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser
              may take a digital photograph of your eye which can be kept on
              record to use in future appointments to evaluate any changes to
              your eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to evaluate
              your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris which are the
              anterior and posterior of the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
              will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
              to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Field Test:</b> A visual field test can assist with
              assessing your peripheral vision, which may be beneficial for
              identifying any signs of glaucoma.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dilated Fundus Exam:</b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
              optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
              view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
              patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
              retinal damage.
