                    To compare optometrists in Traralgon, Victoria, you can use
                    factors such as eye
                    <b
                      >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and

                    >
                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at an optometrist in Traralgon, Victoria visit
                    their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all
                    major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store.
                    There are many different lens options available for
                    prescription glasses such as single-vision, multifocal and
                    high-index lenses. Most optometrists in Traralgon, Victoria
                    will offer these lenses although it is good to make sure.
                    There are also lens add-ons available to enhance your
                    glasses such as anti-reflective and blue light filters.
                    Finally, if you are looking to purchase a pair of glasses
                    after your eye test, you can compare the different styles
                    and colours you are interested in from the optometrists in
                    Traralgon, Victoria. Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of

                      dispenser will conduct a tonometry test which involves the
                      use of a machine that will release small puffs of air into
                      your eyes. This will assist with measuring pressure in the

                      getting a clear view of the retina. This test is typically
                      carried out for patients with diabetes and those who may
