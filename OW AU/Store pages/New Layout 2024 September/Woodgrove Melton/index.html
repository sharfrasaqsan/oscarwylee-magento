                    services in the Melton area may be dependent on an
                    individual’s eye care needs, age and underlying health

                    To compare optometrists in Melton, Victoria, you can use
                    factors such as eye
                    <b
                      >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and

                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at an optometrist in Melton, Victoria visit their
                    website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all major
                    health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store. There
                    are many different lens options available for prescription
                    glasses such as single-vision, multifocal and high-index
                    lenses. Most optometrists in Melton, Victoria will offer
                    these lenses although it is good to make sure. There are
                    also lens add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Melton, Victoria.
                    Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and

                      then selecting the frames that suit me and my needs. The
                      optometrist was clear when giving instructions and making

                      The service I received was very good and my glasses

                      the style and fit of the frames. The optometrist was
                      extremely thorough and referred me to an ophthalmologist
                      for further review. I would recommend Oscar Wylee.
