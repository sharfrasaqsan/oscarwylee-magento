                    To compare optometrists in Rosny Park, you can use factors
                    such as eye
                    <b
                      >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and
                      add-ons and eyewear offered.</b
                    >
                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at a Rosny Park optometrist in Hobart, visit their
                    website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all major
                    health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store. There
                    are many different lens options available for prescription
                    glasses such as single vision, multifocal and high index
                    lenses. Most optometrists in Rosny Park will offer these
                    lenses although it is good to make sure. There are also lens
                    add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Rosny Park, Hobart.
                    Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and

                    an updated or new prescription which will require you to see
                    an optometrist. This will ensure your prescription
                    sunglasses are appropriate for your visual needs.

                      <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical
                      dispenser will conduct a tonometry test which involves the
                      use of a machine that will release small puffs of air into
                      your eyes. This will assist with measuring pressure in the

                      can be kept on record to use in future appointments to
                      evaluate any changes to your eye.

                      <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to
                      evaluate your eye health, by examining your cornea and

                      optometrist will have you view an image through different
                      lenses and ask you to confirm which helps you see the

                      <b>Visual Field Test:</b> A visual field test can assist

                      beneficial for identifying any signs of glaucoma.

                      an optometrist assess your health in more detail by
                      getting a clear view of the retina. This test is typically
                      carried out for patients with diabetes and those who may
                      be at risk of developing retinal damage.
