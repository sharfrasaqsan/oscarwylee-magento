              exceptional. I’ve bought many of my glasses here in the past and
              will continue to do so in the future.

              <b>Simon Morrison: </b>
              Very happy with my recent experience at the optometrist store. The
              optometrist Michael explained everything clearly and how my eyes
              have travelled over the last two years. Also talked about
              different impacting features on my eyes, such as blood pressure.
              Front of house staff were also excellent and very friendly. Will
              be back for sure.

              them or thank them enough. Great service.

          <ul class="store-ul">
            <li>
              <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser will
              conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
              will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist
              with measuring pressure in the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>A Digital Photograph:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser
              may take a digital photograph of your eye which can be kept on
              record to use in future appointments to evaluate any changes to
              your eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to evaluate
              your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris which are the
              anterior and posterior of the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
              will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
              to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Field Test:</b> A visual field test can assist with
              assessing your peripheral vision, which may be beneficial for
              identifying any signs of glaucoma.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dilated Fundus Exam:</b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
              optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
              view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
              patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
              retinal damage.
