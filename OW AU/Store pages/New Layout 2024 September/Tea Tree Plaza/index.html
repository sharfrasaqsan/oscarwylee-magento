                    To compare optometrists in Tea Tree Plaza, you can use
                    factors such as eye
                    <b
                      >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and
                      add-ons and eyewear offered.</b
                    >
                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at a Tea Tree Plaza optometrist in Modbury, visit
                    their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all
                    major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store.
                    There are many different lens options available for
                    prescription glasses such as single vision, multifocal and
                    high index lenses. Most optometrists in Tea Tree Plaza will
                    offer these lenses although it is good to make sure. There
                    are also lens add-ons available to enhance your glasses such
                    as anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you
                    are looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye
                    test, you can compare the different styles and colours you
                    are interested in from the optometrists in Tea Tree Plaza,
                    Modbury. Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with

                      use of a machine that will release small puffs of air into

                      getting a clear view of the retina. This test is typically
                      carried out for patients with diabetes and those who may
