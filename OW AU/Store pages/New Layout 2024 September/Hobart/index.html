                    >
                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at a Hobart optometrist in Tasmania, visit their
                    website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all major
                    health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store. There
                    are many different lens options available for prescription
                    glasses such as single vision, multifocal and high index
                    lenses. Most optometrists in Hobart will offer these lenses
                    although it is good to make sure. There are also lens
                    add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Hobart, Tasmania.
                    Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and
                    modern inspirations in bold colours and subtle designs.

                    prescription is expired, you can book an eye test to receive
                    an updated or new prescription which will require you to see
                    an optometrist. This will ensure your prescription
                    sunglasses are appropriate for your visual needs.

                      dispenser will conduct a tonometry test which involves the
                      use of a machine that will release small puffs of air into
                      your eyes. This will assist with measuring pressure in the

                      getting a clear view of the retina. This test is typically
                      carried out for patients with diabetes and those who may
