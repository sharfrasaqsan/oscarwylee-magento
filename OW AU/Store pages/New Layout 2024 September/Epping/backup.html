            To compare optometrists in Epping, you can use factors such as eye
            <b
              >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and add-ons and
              eyewear offered.</b
            >
            To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important to
            receive an eye test at least once every two years. There are
            different types of tests that can be performed in an eye test and
            not all optometrists may offer the same tests. Health funds can be
            used to help cover some of the cost of your frames and lenses. To
            find out if your health fund is accepted at Epping optometrist in
            Victoria, visit their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept
            all major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store.
            There are many different lens options available for prescription
            glasses such as single-vision, multifocal and high-index lenses.
            Most optometrists in Epping will offer these lenses although it is
            good to make sure. There are also lens add-ons available to enhance
            your glasses such as anti-reflective and blue light filters.
            Finally, if you are looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your
            eye test, you can compare the different styles and colours you are
            interested in from Epping optometrists in Victoria. Oscar Wylee
            offers a wide range of frames with vintage and modern inspirations
            in bold colours and subtle designs.

          <ul class="store-ul">
            <li>
              <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser will
              conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
              will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist
              with measuring pressure in the eye.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to evaluate
              your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris which are the
              anterior and posterior of the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
              will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
              to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Dilated Fundus Exam:</b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
              optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
              view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
              patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
              retinal damage.
