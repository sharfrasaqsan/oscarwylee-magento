                    To compare optometrists in Dandenong, you can use factors
                    such as eye
                    <b
                      >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and
                      add-ons and eyewear offered.</b
                    >
                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at a Dandenong optometrist in Melbourne, visit
                    their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all
                    major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store.
                    There are many different lens options available for
                    prescription glasses such as single vision, multifocal and
                    high index lenses. Most optometrists in Dandenong will offer
                    these lenses although it is good to make sure. There are
                    also lens add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Dandenong, Melbourne.
                    Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and

                      Best and most comfortable eye test I have had so far.
                      Staff were quick and very friendly. Choosing my glasses
                      was a breeze as I was left free to choose and not forced
                      into getting designs that I didn’t like or were expensive.
                      I would definitely recommend people to go and visit them.
