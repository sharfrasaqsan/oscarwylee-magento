                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important to
                    receive an eye test at least once every two years. There are
                    different types of tests that can be performed in an eye test and
                    not all optometrists may offer the same tests. Health funds can be
                    used to help cover some of the cost of your frames and lenses. To
                    find out if your health fund is accepted at a Chadstone optometrist
                    in Melbourne, visit their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we
                    accept all major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims
                    in-store. There are many different lens options available for
                    prescription glasses such as single vision, multifocal and high
                    index lenses. Most optometrists in Chadstone will offer these lenses
                    although it is good to make sure. There are also lens add-ons
                    available to enhance your glasses such as anti-reflective and blue
                    light filters. Finally, if you are looking to purchase a pair of
                    glasses after your eye test, you can compare the different styles
                    and colours you are interested in from the optometrists in
                    Chadstone, Melbourne. Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with

                      conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
                      will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist

                      <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
                      will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
                      to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.

                      optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
                      view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
                      patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
