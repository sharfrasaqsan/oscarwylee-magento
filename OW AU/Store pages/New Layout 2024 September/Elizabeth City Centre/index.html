                    To compare optometrists in Elizabeth, you can use factors

                    <b

                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at an Elizabeth optometrist in Adelaide, visit
                    their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all
                    major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store.
                    There are many different lens options available for
                    prescription glasses such as single vision, multifocal and
                    high index lenses. Most optometrists in Elizabeth will offer
                    these lenses although it is good to make sure. There are
                    also lens add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Elizabeth, Adelaide.
                    Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and

                      <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical
                      dispenser will conduct a tonometry test which involves the
                      use of a machine that will release small puffs of air into
                      your eyes. This will assist with measuring pressure in the
                      eye.

                      can be kept on record to use in future appointments to
                      evaluate any changes to your eye.

                    <li>
                      <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to
                      evaluate your eye health, by examining your cornea and
                      iris which are the anterior and posterior of the eye.

                      <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an
                      optometrist will have you view an image through different
                      lenses and ask you to confirm which helps you see the
                      image clearer.

                      <b>Visual Field Test:</b> A visual field test can assist

                      beneficial for identifying any signs of glaucoma.

                      an optometrist assess your health in more detail by
                      getting a clear view of the retina. This test is typically
                      carried out for patients with diabetes and those who may
                      be at risk of developing retinal damage.
