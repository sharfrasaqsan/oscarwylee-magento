                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There

                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is

                    for prescription glasses such as single-vision, multifocal
                    and high-index lenses. Most optometrists in Melbourne
                    Central, Victoria will offer these lenses although it is
                    good to make sure. There are also lens add-ons available to
