                    To compare optometrists in Eastland, Victoria you can use
                    factors such as eye
                    <b
                      >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and
                      add-ons and eyewear offered.</b
                    >
                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at an optometrist in Eastland, Victoria visit their
                    website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all major
                    health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store. There
                    are many different lens options available for prescription
                    glasses such as single vision, multifocal and high index
                    lenses. Most optometrists in Eastland, Victoria will offer
                    these lenses although it is good to make sure. There are
                    also lens add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Eastland, Victoria.
                    Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and

                      If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Both Lawrence
                      and Felicity were wonderful and nothing was too much. Both
                      took the time to answer my questions and the variety of
                      glasses to choose from were amazing. I will be
                      recommending this business to my friends and family.

                      assisting my daughter and I to choose the right frames. He
                      was patient and kindhearted and an absolute pleasure to

                      dispenser will conduct a tonometry test which involves the
                      use of a machine that will release small puffs of air into
                      your eyes. This will assist with measuring pressure in the

                      getting a clear view of the retina. This test is typically
                      carried out for patients with diabetes and those who may
