                    To compare optometrists in Knox, Victoria, you can use

                    <b

                    To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important
                    to receive an eye test at least once every two years. There
                    are different types of tests that can be performed in an eye
                    test and not all optometrists may offer the same tests.
                    Health funds can be used to help cover some of the cost of
                    your frames and lenses. To find out if your health fund is
                    accepted at an optometrist in Knox, Victoria visit their
                    website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we accept all major
                    health funds and provide on-the-spot claims in-store. There
                    are many different lens options available for prescription
                    glasses such as single-vision, multifocal and high-index
                    lenses. Most optometrists in Knox, Victoria will offer these
                    lenses although it is good to make sure. There are also lens
                    add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
                    anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are
                    looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test,
                    you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                    interested in from the optometrists in Knox, Victoria. Oscar
                    Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and modern
