            To care for your vision and eye health, it is important to receive
            an eye test at least once every two years. There are different types
            of tests that can be performed in an eye test and not all
            optometrists may offer the same tests. Health funds can be used to
            help cover some of the cost of your frames and lenses. To find out
            if your health fund is accepted at Greensborough Plaza optometrist
            in Victoria, visit their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we
            accept all major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims
            in-store. There are many different lens options available for
            prescription glasses such as single-vision, multifocal and
            high-index lenses. Most optometrists in Greensborough Plaza will

            lens add-ons available to enhance your glasses such as
            anti-reflective and blue light filters. Finally, if you are looking
            to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye test, you can compare
            the different styles and colours you are interested in from
            Greensborough Plaza optometrists in Victoria. Oscar Wylee offers a

              Lovely service and a great range. Looking forward to picking up my
              new glasses and sunnies. My examination was thorough and helpful
              and my optometrist was very friendly. When choosing my frames,
              Daisy was very friendly and thorough and helped me choose some
              very nice frames and made sure I was happy with my purchase. I’ll
              be back.

              Great experience. Staff friendly. The optometrist was
              professional, thorough, and made you feel comfortable. Highly
              recommend.

              Outstanding service! With only 10 days until Christmas, Shanae and
              Daisy did everything possible to ensure I had glasses for the
              holidays. I will never buy glasses from anywhere else.

            Greensborough Plaza optometrist Victoria location include
            <b>a tonometry test, a slit lamp exam and a refraction test.</b>
            Additional tests that may also be performed can include
            <b> a dilated fundus exam.</b> The treatments or eye-care processes

          <ul class="store-ul">
            <li>
              <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser will
              conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
              will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist
              with measuring pressure in the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to evaluate
              your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris which are the
              anterior and posterior of the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
              will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
              to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dilated Fundus Exam:</b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
              optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
              view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
              patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
              retinal damage.
