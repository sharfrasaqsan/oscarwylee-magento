          <ul class="store-ul">
            <li>
              <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser will
              conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
              will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist
              with measuring pressure in the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to evaluate
              your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris which are the
              anterior and posterior of the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
              will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
              to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dilated Fundus Exam:</b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
              optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
              view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
              patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
              retinal damage.
