            To compare optometrists in Bendigo, you can use factors such as eye
            <b
              >tests offered, health fund coverage, lens types and add-ons and
              eyewear offered.</b
            >
            To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important to
            receive an eye test at least once every two years. There are
            different types of tests that can be performed in an eye test and
            not all optometrists may offer the same tests. Health funds can be
            used to help cover some of the cost of your frames and lenses. To
            find out if your health fund is accepted at an Bendigo optometrist
            in Victoria, visit their website. In the case of Oscar Wylee, we
            accept all major health funds and provide on-the-spot claims
            in-store. There are many different lens options available for
            prescription glasses such as single vision, multifocal and high
            index lenses. Most optometrists in Bendigo will offer these lenses
            although it is good to make sure. There are also lens add-ons
            available to enhance your glasses such as anti-reflective and blue
            light filters. Finally, if you are looking to purchase a pair of
            glasses after your eye test, you can compare the different styles
            and colours you are interested in from the optometrists in Bendigo,
            Victoria. Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and
            modern inspirations in bold colours and subtle designs.

          <ul class="store-ul">
            <li>
              <b>A Tonometry Test:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser will
              conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine that
              will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will assist
              with measuring pressure in the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>A Digital Photograph:</b> An optometrist or optical dispenser
              may take a digital photograph of your eye which can be kept on
              record to use in future appointments to evaluate any changes to
              your eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Slit Lamp Test:</b> A slit lamp test can be used to evaluate
              your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris which are the
              anterior and posterior of the eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Refraction Test:</b> During a refraction test, an optometrist
              will have you view an image through different lenses and ask you
              to confirm which helps you see the image clearer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Field Test:</b> A visual field test can assist with
              assessing your peripheral vision, which may be beneficial for
              identifying any signs of glaucoma.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dilated Fundus Exam:</b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
              optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a clear
              view of the retina. This test is typically carried out for
              patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of developing
              retinal damage.
