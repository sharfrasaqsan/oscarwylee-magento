    <div class="intro-section">
      <p class="para-content">
        There are many options available when buying online prescription glasses
        and sunglasses. People can choose from different frame styles, glasses
        types and lenses. Prescription glasses are corrective devices used to
        give customers clear and comfortable vision according to the
        prescription given to them by an optometrist. Similar to glasses,
        sunglasses can be both prescription and non-prescription. Sunglasses are
        designed to protect the eyes from harmful UV rays emitted from the sun
        while also being a stylish fashion accessory. The price for glasses and
        sunglasses varies greatly depending on the brand and the lenses.
        <br /><br />

        glasses and sunglasses for men, women, children and seniors as well as a

            tend to be more feminine in design, with softer shapes and lighter
            colours. The styles of glasses that are typically considered women’s
            glasses are round glasses, cat-eye glasses, butterfly glasses,
            rectangle glasses and geometric glasses, as these glasses feature
            softer and more feminine designs and will suit most face types.

            tend to be more masculine in design, with simple patterns, solid

            The best glasses for men are ones that complement the facial shape
            and features of each individual, giving them confidence. The best

          <p class="para-content">
            Prescription sunglasses are a
            <b
              >type of sunglasses that have prescription lenses. Prescription
              lenses are a type of lens that has a magnification power or
              prescription, designed to correct vision issues such as
              nearsightedness.</b
            >
            Prescription lenses can be plus or minus powered, convex or concave,
            depending on the vision issue. Non-prescription and
            <a href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/sunglasses.html"
              >prescription sunglasses</a
            >
            are a type of glasses that are made to protect the eyes from the sun
            and its UV rays. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
            long-term exposure to UV rays can be damaging to the eyes, including
            an increased risk of eye cancers and cataracts. Sunglasses are
            designed to protect against UV light and help prevent sun damage.
            Types of sunglasses include tinted sunglasses and polarised
            sunglasses. Tinted sunglasses have lenses covered in a pigmented dye
            which provides sun protection and limited glare protection.
            Polarised sunglasses have lenses coated with a filter that helps to
            protect against the sun but also helps to reduce glare.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, our sunglasses can be made with or without
            prescription lenses. If you have an existing prescription, our staff
            will be able to help you pick a sunglasses frame and organise adding
            this prescription to your lenses. If you don’t have an existing
            prescription but feel your vision is not clear, one of our dedicated
            and experienced optometrists can provide an eye test and determine
            if you need a prescription. Oscar Wylee prescription sunglasses
            provide the double benefit of protecting your eyes when outdoors,
            whilst also ensuring you have clear vision. Visit our Oscar Wylee

            sunglasses.

              >
              As a person ages, their eyes also age and change. According to
              Health Direct, Australia’s national virtual health information
              service, the lens of the eye hardens and loses flexibility with
              ageing, which can make it difficult to focus on objects close up.
              Presbyopia may make close-up tasks such as reading and writing
              difficult, which is why the glasses to help correct this vision
              issue are colloquially called
              <a href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/reading_glasses.html"
                >reading glasses</a
              >. <br /><br />
              Reading glasses can come in a variety of frame shapes, sizes and
              colours. Reading glasses will generally have a convex-shaped lens
              to help correct presbyopia. The lenses in reading glasses can be
              single-vision, meaning there is one prescription over the lens to
              correct presbyopia only. They can also be bifocal, with two
              prescriptions over the lenses if a person also has trouble with
              nearsightedness, or a multifocal lens with three prescriptions for
              near, far and intermediate vision issues. At Oscar Wylee we can
              provide reading glasses for those who are struggling with reading
              and other close work, among other prescription glasses for near
              and farsightedness issues. Come into one of our stores for an eye
              test, and our optometrist will be able to recommend the
              appropriate prescription. You will be able to get your reading
              prescription fitted to any of our optical frames.
              <br /><br />
              Reading glasses can also be purchased over-the-counter in places
              like chemists, with the prescription in the lenses preset, and the
              same across both eyes. However, whilst over-the-counter reading
              glasses may be cheaper, they will not be as effective in treating
              presbyopia as lenses that have a prescription an optometrist has
              recommended to suit your individual needs. Visit your local Oscar
              Wylee stores and our friendly team will be able to provide a full
              quote for reading glasses.

            <p class="para-content">
              Computer glasses are a type of glasses that are
              <b
                >used when a person is doing work on a computer or laptop,
                especially for extended periods of time.</b
              >
              According to Cedars Sinai, a Californian healthcare organisation,
              focusing on a computer or digital screen for an extended period of
              time can be hard on the eyes, leading to issues such as eye
              strain, eye fatigue, dry eyes and headaches. This group of vision
              problems is referred to as computer vision syndrome or digital eye
              strain. Computer glasses, sometimes known as blue light glasses,
              aim to prevent the symptoms of digital eye strain by relieving
              some of the strain on the eye. Computer glasses may relieve
              digital eye strain by having a prescription for intermediate work,
              helping the eye to focus better and more clearly on a screen.
              Computer glasses may have no prescription, but have an anti-glare
              coating, which limits how much glare from the computer screen hits
              the eye. Blue light filters are another common feature of computer
              glasses, which is a coating on the glasses lens which helps reduce
              the amount of blue light, a type of light that emits from the
              screen, entering the eye.
              <br /><br />
              At Oscar Wylee, you can add our blue light filter to any pair of
              prescription glasses up to 1.67 index, or to non-prescription
              glasses, for an additional $80. This blue light filter also
              includes an anti-glare coating. For a full quote on how blue light
              filters, visit your local Oscar Wylee store.

              sunglasses and are typically designed to be durable and secure on
              the face, so they don’t fall off during sports activities. At
              Oscar Wylee we have two sports frames Ryan and Stevo. Ryan is a
              durable sports sunglass, with a curved shape that is designed for
              a tight yet comfortable fit, crafted with both performance and
              style in mind. Stevo is a wrap-around pair of sunglasses that has
              a strong curve with a comfortably secure fit. The sunglasses can
              be purchased from $169 in the classic colour Obsidian Black Matte.

            many different types of frames a person can choose from, ranging in

            <p class="para-content">
              Full-rim glasses frames have
              <b
                >lenses that are completely encased by the frame helping to hold
                the glasses together and provide structure.</b
              >
              The rim of full-rim glasses goes around the whole lens, which is
              different to semi-rimmed frames where the rim only covers half of
              the lenses. Full-rim frames are sturdier than other styles of
              glasses meaning they are harder to break than half-rims or rimless
              glasses. This glasses style can be a bold look if the rim is
              particularly thick or angular which may not be to everyone’s
              fashion taste and also may not suit all face shapes.
              <br /><br />
              Full-rim glasses are suitable for both masculine and feminine
              features as their classic style complements many faces. The
              material of full-rim frames may be plastic, metal and
              polycarbonate. At Oscar Wylee we offer a wide range of full-rimmed
              glasses starting from $169 in a variety of colours, shapes and
              materials.

              What are the Semi-rimless Glasses Frames?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              Semi-rimless glasses frames, also known as half frames, are a
              <b
                >type of glasses that have a rim only around the top half or the
                bottom half of the lenses.</b
              >
              Semi-rimless glasses frames are designed to be lightweight on the
              face, a great alternative to a heavier full-rimmed frame. As these
              glasses don’t have a rim on either the top or bottom of the frame,
              the weight is reduced, making for more comfortable wear. While
              semi-rimless frames are more sturdy than rimless frames, they are
              not as durable as full-rimmed glasses that fully protect the
              lenses. Semi-rimless frames are perfect for people who want a
              minimalist look but still desire the durability of full-rimmed
              glasses.
              <br /><br />
              At Oscar Wylee, we have a selection of semi-rimmed, half-frame and
              browline glasses available from $169.

            <p class="para-content">
              Rimless glasses frames are a glasses style that has
              <b
                >no rim around the lenses meaning the lenses attach to the nose
                bridge and the arms of the glasses only.</b
              >
              Rimless frames are a minimal style that allows the lenses to blend
              into the face for a subtle look. This kind of glasses frame is
              popular for its lightweight nature as there is no rim adding extra
              heaviness to the face. One con of rimless glasses is that they are
              more prone to breakage as they do not have a rim or frame to
              connect them. The price for rimless frames varies depending on the
              brand and the type of lenses used in these frames.
              <br /><br />

            <p class="para-content">
              Cat-eye glasses glasses frames are a
              <b
                >fun and stylish choice of eyewear that help accentuate the eye,
                bringing balance to the face.</b
              >
              Cat-eye glasses describe a frame that is designed to mimic a cat’s
              eye with curved, swooping upper corners. A cat-eye glasses frame
              highlights the top portion of the face, giving it new dimensions
              and more balance, making a bold and feminine statement.
              <br /><br />
              Cat-eye glasses have been a popular frame choice for decades, with
              many celebrities, popularising the style. Cat-eye frames have
              remained a staple in glasses making them a fashionable option to
              wear all year round, through the summer and winter seasons. The
              feline design also complements both casual and formal outfits
              meaning it can be dressed up or down and take you from work to a
              night out.

              Round glasses frames are a
              <b>classic shape that is circular with smooth, curved edges.</b>
              Round frames are a flattering style as they are classic and sleek,
              with a shape that contrasts angular features. These glasses add
              softness to the features, especially the eyes and have endured as
              a popular frame for multiple face shapes. The timeless, circular
              shape of round frames can be worn as a casual style or dressed up
              for a night out. Round glasses are a popular frame choice as they
              are a neutral shape that can elevate your style or fit right in
              with everyday wear.
              <br /><br />
              At Oscar Wylee, we offer a wide range of round glasses frames

            <p class="para-content">
              Oval glasses frames are a
              <b
                >style of glasses that are oval or egg-shaped in a structure
                that has lenses wider than they are tall.</b
              >
              Oval frames have smooth curves that work to balance any harsh or
              angular features. This style of frame is a classic frame shape, as
              its simple oval structure makes them a very wearable piece of
              eyewear, suitable for wide demographics and different occasions.
              An oval frame is versatile in its design, available in many
              colours and frame thicknesses. The simplicity of the oval frame
              means they can complement any face or gender, no matter whether it
              is more masculine or more feminine presenting.
              <br /><br />
              Oscar Wylee has a large selection of oval glasses frames starting
              from $169. They are available in different colours, sizes and
              materials to suit many personal styles.

              What are the Geometric Glasses Frames?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              Geometric glasses frames are a
              <b
                >stylish choice of eyewear that is different from the standard
                glasses shapes such as rectangles and round.</b
              >
              Geometric frames refer to glasses in which the frame around the
              lens has many angles, featuring four or more sides. Geometric
              glasses are available in a variety of shapes including pentagon,
              hexagon, heptagon and octagon. Geometric glasses are a popular
              choice as they bring interesting angles and dimensions to the
              face. Geometric glasses provide a hint of fun and originality to a
              look with their unique shape.
              <br /><br />
              At Oscar Wylee, we have a selection of geometric glasses that can
              be purchased from $169. Our geometric frames are available in
              different colours and materials to suit many styles.

          <p class="para-content">
            Lenses for glasses are
            <b
              >two pieces of material, typically plastic or glass that are
              mounted in a frame.</b
            >
            These lenses for glasses sit over the eyes and provide vision
            correction or help to protect the eyes. Lenses for glasses may be
            non-prescription, also known as plano lenses, which can include
            sunglasses. Glasses lenses will commonly have a prescription or
            magnification power to correct a vision issue. <br /><br />
            The price of lenses varies greatly depending on the kind. Standard
            lenses that do not have a prescription will typically be the lowest
            price with prescription lenses at a higher price point. Lenses price
            increases when different add-ons are applied to the lenses such as
            blue light filter, anti-glare and mirror coating for sunglasses.
            Certain types of lenses such as multifocals or high index lenses are
            at a higher price point.
            <br /><br />
            The different types of lenses for glasses include single vision
            lenses, bifocal lenses, trifocal lenses, progressive (multifocal)
            lenses, photochromic lenses, polarised lenses, high-index lenses,
            aspheric lenses, digital lenses and tinted lenses.

            <p class="para-content">
              Determining which lens is better for sunglasses
              <b>depends on the purpose of the sunglasses for the wearer.</b>
              For example, the colour of the tint can be chosen for different
              activities, brown sunglasses are good for driving but will distort
              colours. Darker tints such as grey and green reduce eyestrain in
              bright conditions. Polarised sunglasses are recommended for
              outdoor activities such as fishing as the coating allows the
              wearer to see through the glare on the water’s surface. Another
              type of lens in sunglasses is photochromic which transitions from
              dark to clear in response to the sun. These sunglasses lenses are
              popular for people who need vision correction and don’t want to
              constantly switch between sunglasses and glasses.

                  >
                  Transition lens glasses have a chemical coating in the lens,
                  which causes the lenses to darken in response to direct
                  sunlight, the more rays there are, the darker the adaptive
                  lenses will become. As mentioned, these types of lenses are
                  popular with people who have prescription glasses and don’t
                  want to switch between their sunglasses all day. <br /><br />
                  At Oscar Wylee, we offer photochromic lenses for all lens
                  indexes and Transitions® lenses in 1.6 and 1.67 indexes.

                  >Tinted lenses are darker than clear standard lenses and dim
                  the harsh light of the sun. Polarised lenses offer UV
                  protection and also cut out glare on the horizontal
                  wavelength. Photochromic are transition lenses that change
                  from clear to dark depending on the sun. Mirror coated lenses
                  have a coating on the surface of the lenses to reflect light,
                  preventing them from entering the eye. Finally, gradient
                  lenses have a tint that is darker at the top and gets lighter
                  towards the bottom of the lens. <br /><br />
                  Prescription sunglasses are tinted lenses that protect the
                  eyes from the sun that contain corrective lenses for a
                  person’s vision. Prescription sunglasses are a great way to
                  ensure you can protect your eyes while also correcting your
                  vision. The lenses of prescription sunglasses protect the eyes
                  from the ultraviolet radiation that is emitted from the sun
                  which can affect the eyes and lead to serious eye conditions
                  such as ocular melanoma and cataracts.

              are initially produced as a round shape. The shape of a lens will
              depend on the shape and type of glasses the lenses are being put
              into. For example, an oval frame will have oval-shaped lenses that
              have been cut to fit that particular pair of glasses. Lenses can
              be customised to suit the customer's needs and lifestyle. Some
              customisations include lens colour. At Oscar Wylee we offer a
              number of tinted lenses to choose from such as mirror tints in
              pink, blue, silver and orange, lolly tints in yellow, pink, red
              and blue and sunglasses tints available in grey brown and green.
              These tints typically come at an additional cost on a pair of
              standard glasses.

                  Bifocal glasses look just like regular glasses but have a line
                  that separates the two prescriptions in the lens. The smaller
                  area at the bottom of the lens holds the near/reading
                  prescription, which aids in close-up activities such as
                  knitting or reading. The larger top area contains the distance
                  prescription which can help a person see far objects such as
                  street signs and the tv. <br /><br />
                  At Oscar Wylee, one pair of bifocal prescription glasses

                  What are the Glasses with Trifocal Lenses?
                </h4>
                <p class="para-content">
                  Glasses with trifocal lenses are similar to bifocal and
                  progressive lenses as they
                  <b

                    distinct lines.</b
                  >
                  As glasses with trifocal lenses have distinct lines separating
                  each prescription, the eyes know exactly where to look to see
                  at the three different distances. There may be a period of
                  adjustment where the eyes are getting used to having many
                  prescriptions in the one lens. Like bifocals and multifocals,
                  trifocals are great for people who don’t want to switch
                  between different glasses.
                  <br /><br />
                  Oscar Wylee does not sell trifocal lenses but we do offer
                  multifocal and bifocal glasses lenses.

                  The term progressive refers to the change in power in the lens
                  which happens gradually rather than abruptly. As opposed to
                  bifocal lenses, progressive lenses don’t have a line
                  separating the prescriptions instead they are blended together
                  to create a seamless transition. Progressive lenses, also
                  known as multifocals, are known for their convenience as with
                  three prescriptions all on the one lens, you do not need to
                  switch between several pairs of glasses.

                  these being 1.5 index lens (standard), 1.6 mid index lens (35%
                  lighter and thinner than standard), 1.67 index lens (50%
                  lighter than standard) and 1.74 index lens (60% lighter and
                  thinner than standard). Glasses with high index lenses are
                  made with a special material, therefore, they are often at a
                  higher price point than normal optical lenses. At Oscar Wylee,
                  our high index lenses are priced individually, according to
                  thickness. Visit us in-store for a full quote.

                  What are the Glasses with Aspheric Lenses?

                <p class="para-content">
                  Glasses with aspheric lenses refer to
                  <b
                    >the profile of the lens which is flatter than a normal
                    optical lens i.e. not spherical.</b
                  >
                  Aspheric lenses help to reduce eye distortion and they are
                  thinner, lighter and flatter. These slimmer lenses have a
                  complex surface that changes in curvature gradually from the
                  centre to the outer edge of the lens. <br /><br />
                  At Oscar Wylee, our high index lenses are also aspheric. A
                  lens that is both high index and aspheric will be flatter and
                  thinner, often more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable for
                  those with a strong prescription.

                  Glasses with digital lenses, also known as computer glasses,
                  are
                  <b>worn when working on a computer to reduce eye strain.</b>
                  Digital lenses will often have an anti-reflective coating, a
                  blue light filter and sometimes a level of intermediate
                  prescription. The blue light filter in the glasses blocks
                  potentially harmful rays from entering the eye and may prevent
                  computer vision syndrome. Computer vision syndrome is an issue
                  caused by prolonged screen time use and may be further
                  prevented by taking frequent breaks from screens, blinking
                  often and enlarging the text on the screen.

                  Glasses with tinted lenses
                  <b>include sunglasses and fashion glasses.</b> Sunglasses
                  tints often have a level of UV protection to protect the eyes
                  from the harmful rays emitted by the sun. Fashion lenses have
                  tints in fun colours for their aesthetic purposes but will
                  offer no UV protection. The specific colour of lens tints is
                  used for different purposes. For example, grey tinted
                  sunglasses help to reduce glare, especially on the water
                  because they are a neutral colour. <br /><br />
                  At Oscar Wylee we offer Lolly tints which are fashion lenses
                  in yellow, pink, red and blue. We also offer sunglasses tints
                  for an additional $30 in grey, brown and green and mirror
                  tints in pink, blue, silver and orange.

            <li>
              <b>Choose your lenses:</b>
              If you want non-prescription glasses, all you have to choose is
              your add-ons. You can add a blue light filter for an additional
              $80 or anti-glare for an additional $20. For prescription glasses,
              you will need to have an up-to-date prescription and your pupil
              distance (PD) measurement to place the order online. If you don’t
              have a prescription, book an eye test with Oscar Wylee and receive
              your prescription and PD in-store.

            <li>
              <b>Purchase your glasses:</b>
              Once your add-ons and lenses have been selected, it’s time to
              purchase the glasses. For online purchases, you are unable to use
              your health fund insurance in the transaction. Once you have paid
              you will receive an invoice which you can take to your health fund
              to claim back any coverage provided.

              How to Customise Glasses While Buying?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              Glasses will
              <b
                >almost always need to be customised for customers when buying
                online or in-store.</b
              >
              The main customisation other than frame choice is lenses. A
              glasses prescription determines the type of lenses you need to
              correct your vision. The main different types of lenses are single
              vision, bifocal and multifocal lenses. Some other customisation
              that may be needed is high index lenses which are for people with
              a strong prescription. There are also different add-ons a person
              can add to their lenses to block blue light or reduce glare. If
              you do not know what your prescription is, visit Oscar Wylee
              in-store for an eye test, and our optometrists can assist in
              making sure you are getting the vision assistance you need.
              <br /><br />
              If a person is purchasing sunglasses, they can customise the
              lenses by choosing the colour of the tint or if they want mirror
              tinted, polarised or photochromic lenses. There are also fashion
              tints that can be applied to lenses that don’t provide any UV
              protection but can be chosen for personal style.
              <br /><br />
              Another customisation of glasses includes fit. Glasses are able to
              be customised to your face to ensure they fit and are comfortable
              for all-day wear. The temples of most glasses can be heated and
              bent to fit customised to your ears to prevent them from sliding
              off your face.

              prescription is provided by your optometrist after a routine eye
              test and has information about the type of glasses you need and
              the strength of the prescription for your lenses. Depending on the
              prescription, your optometrist may suggest you need single vision
              lenses or multifocals or even high index lenses if the
              prescription is especially high.

              activities and your lifestyle can inform the type of glasses you
              need. For example, if you spend a prolonged period of time in
              front of a screen for work, school or as a hobby, you may benefit
              from intermediate glasses or a blue light filter.

              glasses, your personal style influences whether you will want to
              wear the glasses that are needed to correct your vision. Finding a
              frame style and colour that you like and want to wear is crucial
              in the glasses-choosing process.

              whether it be to correct vision issues or protect the eyes. They
              can also be used for fashion purposes. The four main types of

              What are the Glasses for Oval Face Shape?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              The glasses for oval face shapes are
              <b
                >rectangle glasses, square glasses, round glasses, aviator

              >
              An oval face shape is longer vertically than it is wide or
              horizontally and has rounded features. The best frame shapes that
              suit oval faces are sharp and wide glasses that emphasise or
              contradict the faces' soft edges. <br /><br />
              The best glasses for an oval face are based on face length,
              cheekbone height, forehead width and chin length. This face shape
              is one of the best faces for glasses wearers, as there are many
              styles that suit an oval face.

              These glasses suit square faces because they contrast the square
              faces' angular features with roundness, add greater definition to
              a square face's best attributes and emphasise the sharp lines of
              the face. A square-shaped face is as broad as it is long and has
              flat cheekbones and a flat chin. The frame shapes that are suited
              to a square face add contrast to the sharp and angular qualities
              of this proportionate shape.

              A round-shaped face is identified by its circular characteristics,
              including smooth lines, full cheeks and wide cheekbones. The
              length of a round face is approximately equal to the width of the
              face. The forehead and jawline are likely to measure the same and
              the hairline is wider than most other face shapes. The frame
              shapes that are best suited for a round face are frames that
              provide angles and strong lines, bringing more structure and
              definition to the face.

              >
              A diamond-shaped face is characterised by its narrow forehead that
              tapers down into a narrow jawline, pointed chin and prominent
              cheekbones which are the widest point of a diamond face. The
              features of a diamond face are structured and defined. The frame
              shapes that are the best fit for a diamond face are ones that help
              to soften the sharp features and contours of the face, helping to
              balance out its strong structure and ones that bring attention to

              What are the Glasses for Pear Face Shape?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              The glasses for pear face shapes are
              <b

                glasses as they enhance the best features of a pear face.</b
              >
              People who have pear-shaped faces can use glasses to complement
              their narrow forehead and draw attention away from a fuller
              jawline, balancing their appearance. If you have a pear face,
              glasses that are complementary include angular shapes that draw
              attention to the eyes and proportionate frames that balance out a
              broader jaw. For those with a pear face shape, glasses help to
              balance, highlight and enhance a person's best features, by adding
              breadth to the smaller elements of the upper face.

            >
            Eye health can be determined by an eye care professional such as an
            optical dispenser, optometrist or ophthalmologist. Regular eye tests
            are a great way to take care of your eye health as these
            professionals can monitor for eye conditions and determine if you
            need vision correction. Other

            include wearing sunglasses and eating a healthy and balanced diet.
            <br /><br />
            People who have refractive errors are given a prescription by their
            optometrists which will then be interpreted by the optical dispenser
            or retail staff to ensure you get the correct lenses needed to give
            you clear and comfortable vision. A refractive error is a type of
            vision issue that affects a person’s ability to see clearly and
            includes farsightedness, nearsightedness, presbyopia and
            astigmatism. If a customer has the eye condition presbyopia, they
            will need reading glasses which are single-vision lenses that
            include a near prescription to make up close tasks easier to see.

              As a child’s vision is constantly developing, it is important to
              keep track of, especially during their schooling years. During
              this time, a child could need glasses in order to help them
              perform their visual tasks as well as further help the development
              of their eyes. To determine if a child needs glasses and vision
              correction, you should book them an eye test which will be
              performed by a skilled optometrist who will cater to the child’s
              needs. <br /><br />

              is necessary to choose a pair of prescribed glasses or prescribed
              sunglasses as an optometrist needs to know what vision correction

              child’s lenses. <br /><br />
              The first step of an eye test is pre-testing, where an eye care
              professional will test the pressure of the eye and take a picture
              of the back of the eye. Next, the patient will see the
              optometrist, who begins the appointment by asking about medical
              history as well as family medical history, why they are here, what
              concerns they have and if they have any existing prescriptions.

              Glasses?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              Oscar Wylee’s refund policy for sunglasses and glasses differs due
              to the inclusion of prescriptions. At Oscar Wylee, we have a
              <b>12 month product guarantee</b> that purports if, within a year
              of delivery or purchase of OW frames or lenses, a customer finds
              possible production faults, such as material issues, defective
              frames or damage from the products manufacturing, Oscar Wylee’s
              satisfaction guarantee offers replacement or repair of your
              purchase, completely free of charge. Oscar Wylee also offers a
              repair or replacement for problems experienced with vision during
              everyday use for claims made within 30 days of delivery or receipt
              of purchase. <br /><br />
              If within 14 days of delivery, you change your mind about any of
              our non-prescription/over-the-counter sunglasses, Oscar Wylee will
              exchange your product for a new pair of your choice as long as the
              sunglasses are still in brand new and saleable condition with the
              original packaging intact. Oscar Wylee does not offer change of
              mind returns and exchanges for any other product.

              What is the Average Shipment Duration for Oscar Wylee Glasses?
            </h3>
            <p class="para-content">
              The
              <b
                >average shipment duration for Oscar Wylee glasses is 7-10
                business days</b
              >
              from the date of purchase in-store, with in-store collection also
              available. If the Oscar Wylee glasses are ordered online or chosen
              to be shipped to a home address, this may take a little longer.
              <br /><br />
              Orders that have incomplete prescriptions will take longer to
              fulfil, as we may need to contact you to verify or obtain missing
              information. This may also be the case when we need to obtain a
              customer’s prescription from an optometrist outside Oscar Wylee.
              <br /><br />
              During peak times of the year such as public holidays and the
              Christmas period, collection time may also be a little bit longer
              than usual.

          <h2 class="subtitle">What are the Factors for Glasses Prices?</h2>
          <p class="para-content">
            There are many different factors that determine glasses prices. Some
            of these include
            <b
              >lens type and customisation, prescription, frame material and
              brand.</b
            >
            The type of lenses added to a pair of glasses can increase the price
            of glasses. The standard type of lens is single vision and will
            typically be the lowest price available. There are also bifocal
            glasses and multifocal glasses which will increase the price.
            Glasses lenses can also have lens coatings applied to enhance the
            wearer’s experience. Lens coatings include anti-glare and blue light
            filters. At Oscar Wylee, we offer an anti-glare coating for an
            additional $20, an anti-glare premium coating is an additional $30
            dollars and a blue light filter for an additional $80. <br /><br />
            Prescription strength can determine the price of glasses in two main
            ways. The first is if a person needs vision correction for multiple
            distances, they may purchase multifocal glasses or bifocal lenses
            which are more expensive than standard single vision lenses. The
            other way prescription strength impacts the price of glasses is if a
            person has a very strong prescription that requires them to purchase
            high-index lenses. High index lenses are thinner and lighter than
            normal lenses and are made with a special material, therefore they
            are sold at a higher price point.
            <br /><br />
            The specific brand is an obvious factor in the price of glasses.
            Designer brands such as Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga and Dior are at a
            high price point to the popularity and quality of the brand. At
            Oscar Wylee, we are a popular brand that is able to sell our frames
            at affordable prices as we’ve cut out the distributor middleman to
            bring you designer-style glasses, directly from the source.
            <br /><br />
            At Oscar Wylee, we offer free shipping for all our products when
            ordered online in Australia. Therefore, the price online and
            in-store will not change. Health insurance can be used in-store at
            Oscar Wylee, to potentially limit how much you pay from your own
            pocket for frames and lenses. While the price of the glasses will
            stay the same, depending on your private health fund insurance, you
            may pay only a portion of the complete price. Frame size and colour
            rarely influence the price of frames although some eyewear companies
            may have different prices depending on the size of the frame. The
            main frame sizes are small, narrow, medium and wide.
