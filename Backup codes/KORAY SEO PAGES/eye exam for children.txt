<h1>Eye Exam for Children: Importance, Different Tests, Benefits, Signs, and Problems</h1>
<p>Eye exams for children are a crucial aspect of taking care of their health and this article will discuss the importance, the different tests performed, the benefits of children’s eye exams and the signs of problems in children's vision. <br><br>An eye exam for children is different from those for adults and can be performed by a paediatric eye doctor or a general optometrist. It is used to detect certain eye problems and conditions that are common in children such as lazy eye, astigmatism, myopia and hyperopia. Eye exams for children are similar to regular eye exams but include certain differences that cater to their needs such as their reading ability and demeanour. A kids’ eye doctor will ensure the child is comfortable and will make adjustments to the type of testing done in order to make sure your child’s eyes are examined no matter what stage of development they are at. There are many benefits to eye exams for children, such as early detection of certain eye diseases, advancement of their academic performance and overall improvement of the quality of life for children who have undiagnosed or misdiagnosed eye conditions.</p>

<h2>What is the Importance of Eye Exams for Children?</h2>
<div class="flexContainer">
<div class="flexText minusPadding" style="margin-left: -0.5rem;">
<p>Eye exams for children are extremely important as they can detect early signs of eye conditions that may be mitigated or even reversed when caught at a young age. Children's vision is also a key source of their learning ability and performance in the classroom. According to ProVision Australia, vision is responsible for around 80% of all learning during a child’s first 12 years, therefore, children’s eye exams are extremely important in their development. <br><br>According to The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, eye disorders are the most common long-term health issue experienced by children along with asthma and allergies. There are more than 411,000 cases of long-term eye conditions among Australian children, most being shortsightedness and longsightedness. These statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show just how important eye exams are for children in order to detect and treat eye conditions.</p>

<h2>What are the Different Tests Done in Eye Exams for Children?</h2>
<p class="minusPadding">There are multiple different tests that are performed in eye exams for children to test their vision and eye health. The eye tests performed on children can be categorised into two different age groups, preschool children’s eye testing and older children’s eye testing. The definition of these two categories and their eye tests are listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Pre-School Children's Eyes Testing:</b> Pre-school eye testing most often involves a vision screening test. Children do not need to be able to read letters to have an eye test as the eye care professional will adjust the exam for the individual child.</li>
<li><b>Older Children's Eye Testing:</b> Eye testing in older children is similar to adult eye tests and is important to ensure your child performs well in school as they may have undiagnosed eye conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Pre-school Children's Eyes Testing</h3>
<p>Pre-school children’s eye testing typically includes kids aged 3-5 and it is different from older children and adult eye exams as kids this age are primarily unable to read, therefore they cannot be tested with the letter chart (Snellen chart). <br><br>There are two different types of eye tests commonly used in pre-school children's eye tests. The first is a vision screening test and the second is a comprehensive eye exam. A vision screening test in Australia is provided by the government and is called the Statewide Eyesight Preschooler Screening or StEPS program. This program offers all 4-year-old children a free eye/vision screening test, which is a series of short tests and is used to identify if they have an eye condition but not determine what it is. A vision screening test is used to determine if the child needs a comprehensive eye exam. If they need an eye exam, this will most likely involve a visual acuity test, although using recognisable shapes instead of letters, a check of the alignment of their eyes, a refraction test and an eye health examination.</p>
<h3>2. Older Children's Eye Testing</h3>
<p>Older children’s eye testing is very similar to an adult eye exam with minor adjustments to ensure the child feels safe and comfortable. The room and test itself are made more engaging for your child’s convenience. The optometrist may test your child for specific conditions that adults do not get tested on. <br><br>A typical eye test for older children will begin with the eye care professional asking questions about the child and their parent's visual family history. In many children’s eye tests, they will use easily recognisable shapes and pictures in place of letters on the LogMAR and Snellen chart. Older children may use the letter chart depending on their reading ability. Next, the child will have their colour vision tested as well as their visual field, ocular eye movements, and eye pressure. Further examination may occur to look for signs of short-sightedness, long-sightedness, lazy eye, astigmatism or turned eyes. The optometrist will also check the back of the eye for eye health issues. Finally, a digital photograph of your child’s eye may also be taken.</p>

<h2>What are the Benefits of Eye Exams for Children?</h2>
<p class="minusPadding">There are many benefits of eye exams for children as it is a crucial part of taking care of their eye health which in turn improves their everyday life. The main benefits of eye exams for children are listed below.</p>
<ol class="minusPadding">
<li><b>Early detection of serious eye diseases:</b> For both children and adults, diagnosing certain eye conditions early makes a significant difference in how they progress and the possibility of treatment.</li>
<li><b>Your child might be unaware that their vision is impaired:</b> Booking an eye exam for your child can bring awareness to any vision issues they may not know are there. It can be difficult for children to know or understand that they have any vision impairment and issues as they may think it is normal.</li>
<li><b>Academic performance improvement:</b> Eye exams for children can help diagnose vision issues and improve academic performance. Vision issues greatly impact your child’s academic performance especially if it affects their reading ability.</li>
<li><b>Your child may face social difficulties at school:</b> Eye exams can detect any untreated eye conditions that may be affecting a child’s confidence and development, leading to difficulties at school.</li>
<li><b>Some children are misdiagnosed with vision problems:</b> Children with vision problems are often misdiagnosed with other behavioural problems which is why it is crucial to get their eyes tested.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Early Detection of Serious Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>Early detection of eye diseases, especially serious ones, is very crucial for children and is a key benefit of eye exams for kids. Early treatment of eye conditions such as refractive errors and childhood cataracts is extremely important as in some cases the symptoms can be minimised or even reversed. Irreversal vision loss can sometimes be prevented if the issue is addressed early in its development. By booking your child into regular eye exams, an eye care professional may be able to identify certain eye conditions early enough that treatment is possible and effective.</p>
<h3>2. Your Child Might be Unaware that their Vision is Impaired</h3>
<p>Young children with undiagnosed vision impairments are often unaware that they see differently than other children, believing that everyone else sees the same things they do. That is why it is extremely important children receive regular eye tests. Children may not complain of abnormalities in their vision as they may think their eyesight is completely normal. Therefore, it is up to parents and school staff to recognise signs of vision impairment in children. <br><br>Children can also find ways to compensate for their vision problems by working extra hard in school, leaving their parents and the child unaware that their vision is impaired. But with a comprehensive eye exam, an eye doctor can determine if the child is suffering from any eye conditions and make them more comfortable with corrective devices such as prescription glasses.</p>
<h3>3. Academic Performance Improvement</h3>
<p>The improvement of academic performance is a major benefit of eye tests. School learning can be significantly hindered if your child has undiagnosed and untreated eye problems. Children rely heavily on their vision in the classroom, whether that’s looking at a whiteboard from a distance, reading books or writing. According to Clarendon Vision Development Center, at least 80% of a young child’s education is done through visual information. Also, a study conducted by Optometry Australia study in 2019, found that 1 in 5 Australian children have an undetected vision problem. That is why is it crucial for children to have regular eye exams if they wish to achieve academic performance improvement.</p>

<div class="flexText minusPadding" style="margin-left: -0.5rem;">
<h3>4. Your Child May Face Social Difficulties at School</h3>
<p>If your children struggle with poor vision, they may face social difficulties at school. Undetected or untreated eye problems can also cause social issues for children. Children with poor vision often have fewer social interactions due to their inability to see adequately, leading them to be excluded from certain activities and by other children or avoid social interactions such as going to the movies with friends. Improving a child’s social interactions is a major benefit of eye exams.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h3>5. Some Children are Misdiagnosed With Vision Problems</h3>
<p>Misdiagnosed and therefore untreated eye conditions and vision problems lead to frustration with learning, negative self-image, discipline and behaviour issues and a slow rate of learning, according to the Canadian Association of Optometrists. In young children, certain eye conditions are misdiagnosed as behavioural disorders such as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Some eye conditions affect a child’s vision causing difficulty focusing and having them struggle to complete assignments, making regular eye exams for kids crucial for their development.</p>

<h2>What are the Signs that Your Children Need an Eye Exam?</h2>
<p class="minusPadding">There are many signs parents can look out for which indicate if a child needs an eye exam and many early warning signs that mean a child could have a vision problem. The common signs that your child needs an eye exam are listed below.</p>
<ul class="minusPadding">
<li><b>Unusual eye movements:</b> Unusual or new eye movements can be early signs of the eye condition nystagmus, which indicates your child needs an eye exam.</li>
<li><b>Low hand-eye coordination:</b> Poor coordination may be caused by a deficiency in visual-motor coordination and is a sign to get your kid’s eyes tested.</li>
<li><b>Sore eyes or constant rubbing:</b> Discomfort in the eyes, including sore eyes or constant rubbing of the eyes, may be an indication of certain allergies that affect the eyes, a sign you should book your child in for an eye exam.</li>
<li><b>Constant statements of headaches or nausea:</b> Headaches or nausea can be an indication of several eye conditions, a big indication your child needs an eye test.</li>
<li><b>Poor focus and writing:</b> Poor focus and handwriting may be signs that the child needs corrective devices such as prescription glasses, which can be confirmed during an eye test.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one or more of these signs, or others, start to affect your child’s daily life, consider booking an eye test appointment for your child.</p>

<h2>What are the Common Eye Problems Found During Eye Exams for Children?</h2>
<p class="minusPadding">The common eye problems that are found during eye exams for children include astigmatism, lazy eye, squint, childhood cataracts, long-sightedness, short-sightedness and colour vision deficiency. These common childhood eye problems and their definitions are listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Astigmatism:</b> Astigmatism is a refractive error common in infants that causes blurred vision, eye strain and increased glare.</li>
<li><b>Lazy eye:</b> Also known as amblyopia, lazy eye causes children to not see properly or at all out of one eye. Caused by the brain favouring one eye, resulting in the other becoming weaker.</li>
<li><b>Squint:</b> Children with squints will have eyes that appear to look in different directions due to unbalanced muscles in the eyes.</li>
<li><b>Childhood cataracts:</b> Childhood cataracts are a rare eye condition that causes vision to become misty or cloudy due to the lens becoming less transparent.</li>
<li><b>Long-sightedness:</b> Also known as hyperopia, long-sightedness is a refractive error that causes issues with near vision making close-up objects blurry.</li>
<li><b>Short-sightedness:</b> Also known as myopia, short-sightedness causes the eyes to struggle with focusing on objects at a far distance.</li>
<li><b>Colour vision deficiency: </b> Also known as colour blindness, colour deficiency means children have difficulty seeing certain colours or they see different colours than other people.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Astigmatism</h3>
<p>Astigmatism is a refractive error that causes blurry vision due to the shape of the eye being more oval instead of round. According to the Boston Children’s Hospital, astigmatism is a common eye condition in infants but it most often clears on its own by the time the child reaches one year old. Eye astigmatism occurs when images in the eye are not focused on one point, due to the irregular shape of the cornea, lens or retina. The symptoms of astigmatism include blurry vision, eye strain, headaches and sensitivity to glare. Optometrists test for astigmatism during a comprehensive eye examination and treat it by prescribing glasses to give your child clear and comfortable vision.</p>
<h3>2. Lazy Eye</h3>
<p>Lazy eye, also known as amblyopia, occurs when a child is unable to see properly or at all out of one eye. It is caused by the brain favouring one eye, leading to the other eye becoming weaker. Lazy eyes are often the result of refractive errors such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness and astigmatism and also occur because of a squint. The symptoms of lazy eye include one eye being partially or fully shut, the head always tilted or turned to one side and one eye appearing turned in a different direction than the other. To treat lazy eye, an eye patch may be used to strengthen the weaker eye. A child can also do specialised exercises to treat lazy eye.</p>
<h3>3. Squint</h3>
<p>A squint is defined as the eyes appearing to look in different directions. A squint is common in babies although they usually outgrow this eye condition when they reach 6 months old. Squints occur when the eye muscles for each individual eye do not work in a balanced way. According to the Raising Children Network (Australia), the symptoms of a squint include eyes that turn in towards the nose or outwards. A squint may become more pronounced when a child has been outdoors, is unwell or tired, or if they are doing close-up activities such as reading. The treatment for a squint includes glasses, surgery or an eye patch.</p>
<h3>4. Childhood Cataracts</h3>
<p>Childhood cataracts is a rare eye condition and is often separated into two categories according to the National Health Service (NHS). The first category of childhood cataracts is congenital cataracts, which present when the baby is born or soon after birth. The second is developmental, infantile or juvenile cataracts which is diagnosed in children and older babies. The symptoms of childhood cataracts include poor vision, a squint and cloudy patches in the lens. Cataracts in children are caused by many reasons, some include an eye injury, a genetic fault inherited from a parent and certain genetic conditions. The treatment for childhood cataracts includes surgery or, if it is not too serious, the condition may have little effect on the vision requiring no treatment.</p>
<h3>5. Long-sightedness</h3>
<p>Also known as hyperopia, long-sightedness is a refractive error that causes people to struggle to see nearby objects. The symptoms of long-sightedness include eye squinting, eye strain, headaches and difficulty reading small print. Long-sightedness occurs because light entering the eye does not focus properly, rather it focuses behind the retina, as opposed to on the retina. Treatment for hyperopia for children includes corrective lenses. Although, according to the Raising Children Network (Australia), if the child has mild long-sightedness, they may not need treatment as the eyes sometimes naturally adjust to see clearly.</p>
<h3>6. Short-sightedness</h3>
<p>Also known as myopia, short-sightedness is a condition in which the eye struggles to focus on objects at a far distance. Short-sightedness occurs when light entering the eye does not focus on the retina properly, leading to symptoms such as headaches, eye strain, blurry distance vision, squinting and struggling to see far away objects. This refractive error is treated with prescription glasses. The lenses used to correct myopia will be concave in shape, helping the light that enters the eye to focus on the retina. Laser eye surgery is also an option, however, this is not recommended for children.</p>
<div class="flexContainer">
<div class="flexText minusPadding" style="margin-left: -0.5rem;">
<h3>7. Colour Vision Deficiency</h3>
<p>Colour vision deficiency, also referred to as colour blindness, is an eye condition that causes people to have difficulty seeing certain colours or, they may see colours in a different way than other people. Colour vision deficiency is a more accurate term than colour blindness, as those with this condition, while they cannot see all colours, are not completely blind to colour. Red and green and their components are the most common colours that people with colour vision deficiency are unable to see. The symptoms of<span>colour vision deficiency</span> include difficulty identifying different colours and trouble separating colours. In children, parents may identify the symptoms of this eye condition when their children are learning to name colours. Treatment is not usually an option for colour vision deficiency as there are few limitations for this condition. It is common for people to only find out they have colour vision deficiency until they are in adulthood.</p>

<h2>What Are the Different Eye Doctors That Perform Eye Exams for Children?</h2>
<p class="minusPadding">There are three different types of eye doctors that perform eye exams for children. These eye care professionals include optometrists, ophthalmologists and orthoptists. The definitions of these eye doctors for children are listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Optometrists (OD):</b> Optometrists perform comprehensive eye exams, prescribe prescriptions for glasses and treat certain eye conditions.</li>
<li><b>Ophthalmologists (MD):</b> Ophthalmologists treat serious eye conditions and have a medical degree in order to perform surgery.</li>
<li><b>Orthoptists (CO):</b> Orthoptists care for patients with eye disorders and can specialise in children’s vision and paediatrics.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Optometrists (OD)</h3>
<p>Optometrists are eye care professionals whose main responsibilities include performing comprehensive eye tests, prescribing corrective devices such as glasses and diagnosing and detecting certain eye disorders. Optometrists are able to refer patients to ophthalmologists when they are faced with more advanced and serious eye conditions they are not trained to treat.</p>
<h3>2. Ophthalmologists (MD)</h3>
<p>Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who have specialised training in eye health. Ophthalmologists assess, manage and treat eye conditions that are beyond the expertise of an optometrist, such as advanced glaucoma. Ophthalmologists also provide eye surgery. A child may be referred to an ophthalmologist if they have an eye issue that requires more advanced care than an optometrist can provide.</p>
<h3>3. Orthoptists (CO)</h3>
<p>Orthoptists are eye care professionals who provide services for patients with eye disorders. They play an important role in detecting, diagnosing and managing eye diseases in both children and adults. Orthoptists often specialise in a range of different areas such as children’s vision and paediatrics, cataract care and retinal disorders.</p>

<h3>How Often Should My Child Have an Eye Exam?</h3>
<p>A child should have an eye exam when you suspect there may be issues with their vision, just before they start school, at the parents' discretion and at the suggestion of an optometrist. Once they start school, it is recommended that children should get regular eye tests and see an optometrist once every two years. It is important for your child to have regular eye exams, as an optometrist will detect whether they need a prescription for glasses.</p>
<h3>Is There a Way to Protect and Keep Your Children's Eyes Healthy?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are many ways to protect and keep your child’s eyes healthy. The main way to protect your child’s eyes is to ensure they have regular eye tests and take them to an eye care professional if you notice any changes in their vision. As has been discussed in this article, children’s eyesight impacts much of their life, especially in school. <br><br>Other ways parents can protect their children’s eye health is to be aware of any family history of eye diseases, and ensure they are spending time outdoors as this can lower their risk of certain eye conditions such as myopia. It is important that when they are outdoors, children are wearing sunglasses as exposure to UV rays can lead to the development of serious eye conditions later in life. Follow the advice of your eye care professional, especially if they prescribe glasses for your child. Limit their screen time to two hours a day and ensure they get proper nutrition as it will not only improve their eye health but their overall health.</p>
