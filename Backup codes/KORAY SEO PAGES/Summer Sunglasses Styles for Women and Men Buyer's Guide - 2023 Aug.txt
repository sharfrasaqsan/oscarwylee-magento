<p class="para-content">The advantage of large sunglasses for women is that the added size of the frame means that the tinted lenses will cover a greater portion of the face, reducing the amount of skin that is vulnerable to UV rays. Large sunglasses are immediately noticeable, yet with the added size of the tinted lenses, large sunglasses also hide the wearer’s most recognisable facial features, creating a sense of privacy for the wearer.</p>
<p class="para-content">Large sunglasses are made of a variety of materials, but clear and see-through materials may interfere with the advantage against sun rays that large glasses have.</p>
<p class="para-content">Large sunglasses are a good summer sunglasses style for women because they offer an even greater level of eye protection than any other glasses style, they are immediately striking and draw positive attention to the wearer and they compliment the facial features of oval shaped and square shaped faces.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">What are Sunglasses?</h2>
<p class="para-content">Sunglasses are glasses with lenses that are tinted or polarised, to be darker and made to protect the eyes from UV rays and sun damage. <a href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/sunglasses.html">Sunglasses</a> are also used in order to reduce or shield the eyes against harsh brightness, glares and reflections.</p>
<p class="para-content">Sunglasses are credited as having been invented by James Ayscough in 1752, however his version was not used to block UV rays. Sunglasses that could accurately and effectively block UV light were first introduced as ‘crooked lenses’ in 1913. Before the invention, devices made by North American indigenous communities were used to reduce the amount of sunlight and glare the eyes received, but could not directly block it.</p>
<div class="sub-div">
<h3 class="sub-div-title">What are the Benefits of Wearing Summer Sunglasses?</h3>
<p class="para-content">The benefits of wearing summer sunglasses are <strong>protection from UV rays, reducing brightness from light and light reflections, reducing glare, skin protection, changing the wearer's appearance and protecting the eyes from wind, dust or other irritations. </strong>The benefits of wearing summer sunglasses are listed below.</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
<li><span class="list-title">Protection from UV rays:</span> Summer sunglasses protect the wearer’s eyes from UV radiation and ultraviolet rays.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Reducing brightness from bright light:</span> Summer sunglasses reduce uncomfortable brightness from any source of light and are especially effective against sunlight.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Reducing glare:</span> Summer sunglasses like polarised sunglasses or photochromic sunglasses can significantly reduce the amount of bright and reflective glare the wearer’s eyes receive.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Skin Protection:</span> Summer sunglasses cover the skin around the eyes, resulting in less UV damage and its UV side effects, such as sunburn or wrinkles.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Changing the wearer’s appearance:</span> Summer sunglasses are a trendy and classic style that come in a wide variety of shapes and frames.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Protecting the eyes from outside irritations:</span> Summer sunglasses have many different styles that cover the eyes and the skin around the eyes. This means that any debris in the air, such as sand, dust or other substances, are stopped by the sunglasses before they reach the wearer's eyes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sub-div">
<h3 class="sub-div-title">What are the Risks of Not Wearing Summer Sunglasses?</h3>
<p class="para-content">The risk factors of not wearing sunglasses are<strong> eye sunburn, cataracts, eye growths and eye cancer.</strong> The risks of not wearing summer sunglasses are listed below.</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
<li><span class="list-title">Eye sunburn:</span> Prolonged and unshielded exposure to UV rays and sunlight can cause photokeratitis, also known as eye sunburn. Eye sunburn is similar to sunburn on other parts of the skin but is specifically applied to the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Cataracts:</span> Prolonged long term exposure to sunlight can exacerbate and speed up the natural process of cataracts forming inside the eye. Sunlight can also cause damage to the lens's protein in a process called glycation, which can cause a similar effect to the formation of cataracts.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Eye growths:</span> Prolonged and unprotected exposure to sunlight and UV rays can cause two separate types of growth in the eyes, know as pinguecula, a growth near the cornea but not on or in it, and pterygium, a flesh growth of the conjunctiva that spreads the cornea.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Eye cancer:</span> Prolonged exposure of sunlight and UV rays to the eyes has the same risk of cancer growths and melanoma as it does across the rest of the body.</li>

<h2 class="subtitle">What Factors Should be Considered When Choosing the Best Summer Sunglasses Styles for Women and Men?</h2>
<div class="example-image-wrapper"><img src="{{media url="wysiwyg/image-folder/glasses/summer-style-for-females-and-males/SummerSunglassStyles_10-Styles-for-Women_OscarWylee_900x600px_1.jpg"}}" alt="style image of men and women sunglasses" class="example-image"></div>
<p class="para-content">The factors that should be considered when choosing the best summer sunglasses styles for men and women are <strong>the wearer’s face shape, the wearer's skin tone, the frames style, and the sunglasses functionality.</strong> The factors that should be considered when choosing the best summer sunglasses styles and why they are important are listed below.</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
<li><span class="list-title">The wearer’s face shape:</span> Sunglasses styles come in many shapes and sizes that may not be suitable for all types of faces. For example, a person with an oval face shape must choose rectangle or square shaped frames for their sunglasses in order to emphasise the face’s better features.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">The wearer's skin tone:</span> The skin tone of the sunglasses wearer must compliment and not clash with the style and colour of the desired sunglasses. Black sunglasses for instance, draw too much away from lighter skin's better features and contrast too sharply, resulting in the glasses taking too much attention away from the wearer.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">The frames style:</span> The style of any summer sunglasses frames must match what the wearer’s desired style is. Rimless aviator glasses are a style of glasses that creates an air of professionalism and class for the wearer, but will not suit a beach fashion or a casual day event.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">The sunglasses functionality:</span> UV protection is vital for the functionality of summer sunglasses and a wearer might wish for a stronger tint in the sunglasses lens, to reduce brightness and glare even further. Summer sunglasses functionality are further increased through the use of addons and extras, such as transition lenses and polarised lenses. <a href="https://www.oscarwylee.com.au/glasses/eye/polarised-sunglasses-blocks-blue-light">Polarised lenses have a light effect on blocking blue light</a> the eyes receive, but blue light coating is more effective for blocking the possible effects of exposure to blue light.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sub-div">
<h3 class="sub-div-title">Why do Women and Men need to Pick the Best Summer Sunglasses style?</h3>
<p class="para-content">Women and men need to pick the best summer sunglasses styles because <strong>a functional pair of sunglasses must be able to block both UVB and UVA rays.</strong> Women and men must research and understand the best sunglasses styles for their purposes, face type and skin tone, in order to make the most of their summer, find the best kind of product for their price range and guarantee their eye safety during the higher UV intensity of the summer season.</p>
</div>
<div class="sub-div">
<h3 class="sub-div-title">Can Men Wear Sunglasses for Women and Vice Versa?</h3>
<p class="para-content">Yes, men can wear sunglasses meant for women and vice versa, women can wear sunglasses meant for men, <strong>because many modern frame styles are made with a unisex appeal.</strong> The main difference between men and women’s sunglasses is the glasses style and colour instead of any perceived gender differences.</p>
<p class="para-content">The exception to the unisex appeal of modern glasses styles comes within the frames size. Men’s summer sunglasses use bigger and wider frames in order to accommodate for the common facial size difference between each gender. Men’s summer sunglasses styles are commonly rectangle frames, square frames or aviator frames in order to suit the practical need for a larger form of frame while still remaining fashionable and trendy. These frame styles are used for their size and are still perfectly suitable for a woman's face as well as a mans.</p>
</div>
<div class="sub-div">
<h3 class="sub-div-title">Can Children Also Wear Sunglasses During Summer?</h3>
<p class="para-content">Children can and should wear sunglasses during summer because <strong>children’s eyes are as vulnerable to sun damage as an adult's eyes are.</strong> Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause conditions such as eye sunburn, cataracts or eye growths. According to doctor Steven J. Lichtenstein, the lens in children's eyes transmits 75% of UV radiation to the retina, compared to the 10% transmission rate of an adult eye.</p>
<p class="para-content">Children’s learning is done approximately 80% through sight and visual skills. Any damage to the eyes can result in stunted learning, poor development and behavioural difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="sub-div">
<h4 class="sub-div-title h4-title">Is There a Difference Between Women's and Men's Summer Sunglasses Styles?</h4>
<p class="para-content">The difference between men’s and women’s summer sunglasses styles is the size and the materials used for each type of glasses. Women’s summer sunglasses use plastic materials more often than men’s sunglasses, and are often thinner, smaller and more diminutive in size. Women’s summer sunglasses come in more shades of colour, and have softer and more flattering curves on the frames and rims.</p>
<p class="para-content">Men’s summer sunglasses are bigger than women’s summer sunglasses in order to fit the larger face better. Men’s summer sunglasses also have a bigger and wider bridge to accommodate for a bigger nose. Men’s summer sunglasses often use single tone and conservative colours, and are blockier and more angular in design and frames. Men’s summer sunglasses styles like aviator glasses also use more metal in the frames creation than women’s summer sunglasses.</p>
