<div class="intro-section">
<p class="para-content">The best glasses for a diamond face are rectangle, square, butterfly, oval, round and cat-eye, as these frame shapes help to soften sharp, contoured features, bringing balance to the strong structure of this face shape. <br><br>A diamond shaped face is characterised by its narrow forehead and prominent cheekbones, tapering down into a narrow jawline and pointed chin. The cheekbones are the widest point of a diamond face. The features of a diamond shaped face are defined and structured. The frame shapes that are the best fit for a diamond face are ones that help to soften the sharp features and contours of the face, helping to balance out its strong structure. The best diamond face glasses are ones that bring attention to the upper part of the face, helping to widen the forehead and bring new proportions to the face. Diamond glasses for a diamond face are not recommended as they add to the sharp structure of the face shape, over-emphasising the hard contours. <br><br>The best glasses for a diamond face, female, male, or any gender, are rectangle, square, butterfly, oval, round and cat-eye. The benefits of these frame shapes and why they suit a diamond face, are listed below.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">1. Rectangular Glasses for a Diamond Face</h2>
<p class="para-content">Rectangle glasses for a diamond face seem like a contradictory choice of eyewear, as a diamond face usually benefits from rounded frames to soften the features. However, if a rectangle glasses frame has just the right amount of angles, it is effective in complementing the features of a diamond face, without enhancing the sharp and contoured structure. A rectangle glasses shape for a diamond face, refers to a frame that has lenses wider than they are tall. The frame is structured and angular in its design. <br><br>Rectangle glasses frames help to complement the angles of a diamond shaped face, without bringing out too many sharp edges. A diamond face shape is characterised by its narrow forehead, wide, defined cheeks and narrow chin, tapered into a point. This structure gives the face a sharp and contoured look. The right angles of a rectangular frame help to complement these facial features, without over-emphasising them. Rectangle frames will not completely eliminate the appearance of the contours of a diamond face, like a round frame, but gently highlight and complement them. Additionally, a rectangle frame helps to draw attention to the eye and forehead area of a diamond face, giving it width and providing the face with balance. <br><br>Rectangle frames are a clean, classic and simple design, making them a long time staple in the eyewear industry. Rectangle frames are a versatile eyewear frame that work for casual and formal outings, transitioning well from day to night. The enduring popularity of rectangle glasses means they are well suited to any season, summer or winter, bringing simple sophistication to a look all year round. <br><br>Rectangle frames are suitable for all genders. Regardless of whether the face is more masculine or more feminine presenting, rectangle frames have the same enhancing benefits. Rectangle glasses for men with a diamond face help to complement the contours of the face and highlight the face's best features. Rectangle glasses for women with a diamond face bring attention to the forehead and eyes, widening these areas and bringing more balance to the facial structure.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">2. Square Glasses for a Diamond Face</h2>
<p class="para-content">Square glasses for a diamond face seem like a contradictory eyewear choice, as rounded glasses are usually a better option for helping to soften the features and bring balance to a diamond face. However, square shaped glasses that have a thin frame or softer corners, such as a squared aviator frame, help to complement and balance the features of a diamond face shape. A square glasses frame for a diamond face, describes a pair of glasses with lenses that are of a similar width and height. <br><br>Square frames with a thin frame and softer curves, such as the squared aviator or navigator frame, highlight and complement the natural contours and sharpness of diamond face shape, such as the strong jaw and cheeks, gently softening them. A square glasses shape for a diamond face, also helps to bring attention to the forehead and eye area. A diamond face shape will have a narrow forehead area. By widening the forehead, square frames bring new dimensions to the face. <br><br>Square glasses are a simple and classic frame shape, a popular choice among glasses wearers. The simple, clean and strong design of a square frame shape, means that they are widely wearable by anyone for any occasion, day or night. The enduring popularity of square glasses ensures that the wearer will be on trend all year round, through the summer and winter seasons. <br><br>The simple design of square glasses suits all faces, whether more feminine or masculine presenting. Square glasses for men with a diamond face work to bring balance and contour to the face. Square glasses for women with a diamond face are good for balancing the face, lengthening and highlighting the facial features.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">What are the Best Sunglasses for Diamond Faces?</h2>
<p class="para-content">The best sunglasses for diamond shaped faces are oval, cat-eye, aviator and browline, as these frames help to soften sharp and contoured features like the jaw and the cheeks, bringing balance to the strong structure of this face shape. Oval, cat-eye, aviator and browline glasses have good sized lenses, which help protect your eyes. The best sunglasses for a diamond face are slightly different from the best optical glasses, as sunglasses have the additional task of protecting your eyes from the sun and UV rays. This means that the best sunglasses frame shape is one that effectively covers the eyes. The best sunglasses for a round face shape are listed below.</p>
<ul class="ordered-list">
<li><span class="list-title">Oval sunglasses: </span>Like oval optical glasses, oval sunglasses are a good choice of eyewear for a diamond shaped face, as the curves of the frame help to soften the features and bring new dimension to the face. Oval sunglasses come in many designs and sizes, providing the coverage needed to help protect your eyes.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Cat-eye sunglasses: </span>Cat-eye sunglasses are beneficial for diamond faces as the swooped upper corners help to bring attention to the forehead and eye area, widening these more narrow features and bringing more balance to the face. Cat-eye sunglasses are an enduring fashion accessory, on trend throughout all seasons.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Aviator sunglasses: </span>Aviator sunglasses are a great choice of eyewear for diamond faces as the curved, tear-drop style of these glasses helps to soften the sharp and contoured features of this face shape. The aviator lens shape is designed to cover as much of the eye as possible for maximum sun protection. Aviator sunglasses are another enduring style of sunglasses, fashionable for any occasion or season.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Browline sunglasses: </span>Browline sunglasses describe a frame in which the top half of the frame rim is darker, and thicker than the bottom. A browline frame helps to bring attention to the upper portion of a diamond face and balance out the wider cheekbones and tapered chin. The shape of the lenses in a browline frame, oval or rectangle, help to give good coverage and protect your eyes from the sun.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-content">The colour choice when picking sunglasses for a diamond shaped face are important. Darker colours like blacks or browns, particularly near the top of the frame, make the sunglasses stand out on the top half of the face, drawing attention away from the cheeks and tapered chin. This helps to bring some new dimension to the face. Patterns like tortoise shell and floral work with a diamond shaped face. <br><br>Cat-eye is generally considered a more feminine frame, however, its powerful ability to shape the upper portion of the face works just as well on a masculine face as it does a feminine face. Cat-eye, browline, oval and aviator sunglasses all work on feminine and masculine faces, helping to soften the features and bring balance to the face, whilst providing adequate eye coverage for sun and UV ray protection. <br><br>At Oscar Wylee, most of our glasses frames can be made into sunglasses, prescription or non-prescription.</p>

<section class="section-border-bottom">
<h2 class="subtitle">What are the Glasses that are Not Good for Diamond Face Shape?</h2>
<p class="para-content">The glasses that are not suitable for a diamond face shape are undersized glasses, oversized glasses or those that are overly sharp and angular. These frames alter the dimensions of the face in a way that is not as flattering as some other frame shapes. The frame shapes that are not recommended for diamond shaped faces are listed below.</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
<li><span class="list-title"> Oversized glasses:</span> Oversized glasses make the features of a diamond face appear very close together, narrowing the forehead and the jawline. When picking glasses for diamond face shapes, the goal is to balance the face. An oversized frame will not achieve this balanced look, making features that should be widened appear smaller.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Undersized glasses:</span> Undersized glasses distort the proportions of a diamond face by making it appear wide. A diamond face shape is characterised by its wide, defined cheeks, which an undersized frame accentuates, giving width to areas of the face that should be minimised.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Sharp, angular glasses:</span> Some angles on a diamond face, such as those from a rectangular frame, help to complement sharp features, however, too many angles or an overly defined frame, overemphasise the contoured lines. This makes the face appear harsher in structure.</li>

<h2 class="subtitle">How to Understand Whether You Have a Diamond face or Not?</h2>
<p class="para-content">To find out whether you have a diamond face, you need to measure the face and consider the characteristics of your facial features. To find out the shape of a face when measuring it, there are four main areas to estimate; the forehead, the cheekbones, the jaw line and the length of the face from chin to hairline. If the cheeks are the widest part of your face, with the forehead narrow, the jawline narrow, and the chin tapering to a point, you have a diamond face shape. The features of a diamond face shape are sharp and contoured. The forehead of someone with a diamond shaped face is smaller than a person with a heart shaped face.</p>
<div class="flex-wrapper">
<div class="flex-left">
<p class="para-content">To determine if you have a diamond face you should follow the instructions below.</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
<li>Measure the length of your face from the tip of the chin to the centre of the hairline.</li>
<li>Measure the width of your face, across the forehead, the cheeks and the jawline. If your cheeks are the widest part of your face, with your jawline significantly smaller and the forehead also narrow, you have a diamond shaped face.</li>
<li>Consider the defining characteristics of a diamond face and if you have these features.</li>
<li>Ask the questions: Is your face sharp and contoured, is your jawline tapered into a point, are your forehead and hairline narrow? If the answer to these questions are yes, you may have a diamond shaped face.</li>

<h2 class="subtitle">How to Choose Best Glasses for Different Face Shapes?</h2>
<p class="para-content">The way to choose the best glasses for different face shapes, is to pick a frame that complements the unique features and structure of that face shape. A frame should work at emphasising certain areas of the face, drawing attention away from other features, to create balance. Just like with a diamond face shape, other face shapes such as round, oval and rectangle have a frame shape that is best suited to their facial features and structure. <br><br>Once a person has determined what face shape they have, they will be aware what areas of the face to highlight, what features to contour or what areas need some proportioning. <br><br>When picking a frame for your face shape, consider the following:</p>
<ol class="ordered-list hightlight-list">
<li>Pick a frame shape that highlights areas that need to be brought forwards or lifted.</li>
<li>Choose a glasses frame that balances the proportions of your face.</li>
<li>Pick a frame colour that helps emphasise the enhancing features of your glasses.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="subtitle">What are the Other Accessories for Diamond Faces along with Glasses?</h2>
<p class="para-content">The other accessories for a diamond face alongside glasses, include jewellery such as earrings and necklaces, and hair accessories. A diamond face is characterised by a narrow forehead, wide cheeks and tapered chin. The best accessories for a diamond face are those that help to soften the features, reduce attention to the jawline and widen the forehead area to balance out the face. Earrings that drop down and have curves, such as hoop earrings, help to soften the sharp features like the jawline and cheeks. Medium length necklaces help draw attention up towards the forehead and cheeks. Hair accessories such as bands and clips, should be put to the side of a diamond face to help give more width to the eyes and the forehead area, and balance out the face.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Does the Best Glasses for Diamond Faces Change From Year to Year?</h2>
<p class="para-content">The best glasses for diamond faces do not change from year to year. The best glasses for diamond faces in 2022 are rectangle, square, cat-eye, oval and round glasses, the same glasses that have always been popular for this face shape. Glasses, whilst an important optical tool to help people see, are also considered a fashion piece. Fashion items tend to come and go in terms of popularity.

<h2 class="subtitle">What are the Other Face Shapes for Glasses Besides Diamond?</h2>
<p class="para-content">There are several other face shapes for glasses besides a diamond. The other face shapes for glasses include round, oval, pear and heart shaped faces. Each face shape is unique, and will have frames that are the most complementary and flattering for that shape.</p>
<ul class="ordered-list">
<li><span class="list-title">Round face shape:</span> A round face shape is circular in nature, characterised by its softer features, smooth lines, full cheeks and wide cheekbones. The best glasses for a round face are square, rectangle and cat-eye as they help to bring angle and structure to the face.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Oval face shape:</span> An oval face shape is similar to a round face shape in that it is circular or rounder in nature. However, an oval face is thinner than a round face. An oval face is longer than it is wide. The best glasses for an oval face shape are rectangle, square and cat-eye glasses as they help to cut the fullness of this face shape and give it some structure.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Pear face shape:</span> A pear face shape is characterised by a narrow forehead, cheekbones slightly bigger than the forehead and a wide, broad jawline. This face shape resembles a triangle. The best glasses for a pear face are cat-eye, round and rectangle glasses as they help draw attention to the eyes and balance out the fuller jaw.</li>
<li><span class="list-title">Heart face shape:</span> A heart shaped face resembles an inverted or upside down triangle, with a wide forehead area and a pointed chin, with high cheekbones. The best glasses for a heart shaped face are oval, rounded and aviator, as the curves in these frames help to soften sharp features, as well as bring width to the eye area. This helps to balance out the width of the forehead and hairline.</li>
