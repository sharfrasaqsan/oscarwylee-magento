            Taking care of your eye health is important at all ages, but as we
            get older, our eyes require more care and attention. At Oscar Wylee,
            we have trained optometrists who are able to take care of your eye
            health needs, whether that is with annual eye tests or multifocal
            fittings. We also offer a wide range of affordable and on-trend
            frames, from subtle and refined to bold, statement pairs.

          <h2>Services for seniors</h2>
          <p>
            Our trusted optometrists are qualified to deal with age-related eye
            problems and to provide appropriate care. Some of the services we
            offer are listed below.
          </p>

          <h3>Senior’s Discount</h3>
          <p>
            In our New Zealand stores, senior citizens aged 65 and over can show
            their Seniors card (Gold card) for 20% off one pair of glasses.
            There is no restriction on lens configuration and this discount can
            be used multiple times.
          </p>

          <h3>Comprehensive Eye Test</h3>
          <p>
            We provide eye tests at all of our New Zealand Oscar Wylee stores.
            If you are over 65 years old, we recommend you have a yearly review
            with one of our trained optometrists.
          </p>

          <h3>Vision Testing for Driving</h3>
          <p>
            Our Oscar Wylee optometrists are equipped to perform vision tests
            for a person’s ability to hold a motor vehicle driving license and
            fill in the required paperwork.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual field test</h3>
          <p>
            Visual Field Testing (VFT) is used to quantify a person’s peripheral
            vision of each eye individually. This test allows the optometrist to
            establish a baseline of your eye health and also diagnose eye
            diseases like glaucoma.
            <br /><br />
            A VFT can be helpful for those with progressive eye diseases, and
            neurological conditions that affect their visual fields as well as
            monocular drivers who need to fit certain criteria to continue
            driving.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>
              Not every Oscar Wylee store offers visual field testing, call your
              nearest location to find out more.</strong
            >
          </p>

          <h3>Retinal Scan</h3>
          <p class="minusPadding">
            A retinal scan is performed by an optometrist and provides insight
            into the health of the eye. It also helps diagnose retinal diseases,
            some of which include:
          </p>

          <ul class="minusPadding">
            <li>
              Optic nerve health (including signs of optic neuritis and atrophy)
            </li>
            <li>
              Diabetic retinopathy (a complication from diabetes that causes
              vision loss due to damaged blood vessels in the eye)
            </li>
            <li>
              Blood vessel health (including hypertension, blockages and
              leakages)
            </li>
            <li>Macular health (including Macular Degeneration)</li>

          <h2>Our Lenses</h2>
          <p>
            Oscar Wylee offers a wide range of lenses to serve your visual and
            lifestyle needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Multifocal lenses</h3>
          <p>
            Multifocal lenses are a convenient solution for people who are both
            nearsighted and farsighted. They contain three different
            prescriptions in one lens—near, intermediate and distance. With
            <a
              href="https://www.oscarwylee.co.nz/multifocal-lenses.html"
              class="linkTo"
              >multifocals</a
            >
            , you have everything you need in one pair, you can read a book,
            watch tv and go for a drive with ease.
          </p>

          <h3>Bifocal glasses</h3>
          <p>
            Bifocals are designed for those who struggle with close-up and far
            vision. The bifocal lens is divided into two defined segments that
            contain different prescriptions, so you don’t have to swap between
            glasses.
          </p>

          <h3>Reading glasses</h3>
          <p>
            Reading glasses are a solution to an age-related eye condition
            called presbyopia. Readers magnify nearby objects, allowing you to
            read a book or do close-range activities comfortably, without blurry
            vision or eye strain.
            <br /><br />
            You may be familiar with over-the-counter reading glasses. These
            have a preset magnification strength and the same prescription in
            both lenses, making them less expensive but unable to provide full
            correction for individuals. That is why we recommend you choose a
            pair of reading glasses from Oscar Wylee, we make them custom to
            your face and prescription needs.
          </p>

          <h3>High index lenses</h3>
          <p>
            High index lenses are designed to bend light more efficiently
            compared to regular lenses, which allows the lenses to be thinner
            and lighter, making them more comfortable for everyday use. For
            people who wear glasses with a strong prescription, it can be
            beneficial to invest in high index lenses.
