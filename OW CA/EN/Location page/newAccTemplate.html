              Optometry is defined as the profession and practice of examining,
              diagnosing and treating eye conditions and ensuring the general
              eye and vision health of patients. It involves using special
              equipment to evaluate whether you require prescription glasses and
              to maintain good eye health. Optometrists are healthcare
              professionals who are qualified to test and examine patients’ eyes
              and their quality of vision, prescribe glasses and medication for
              minor eye problems and are able to identify signs of more serious
              conditions. Optical dispensers are eye care professionals that
              have been trained to fit and dispense frames and lenses based on
              the prescription provided by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.
              The term optician is used internationally but referred to as an
              optical dispenser in Australia.

              non-practising. The total number of optometrists in Australia

              You can easily find your nearest Oscar Wylee store on this
              locations page of our website. Find Optometrist Near Me is a way
              for you to find an Oscar Wylee optometrist within the area you
              live in. There are a few things to consider before taking an
              appointment with an optometrist. It is important to be familiar
              with what type of services optometrists have to offer so you can
              get a better understanding of what you can expect during your
              appointment. Consult with your optometrist on what you may need to
              bring to your appointment and if there is anything you need to
              prepare beforehand. Finally, ensure you have assistance with
              transport as the optometrist may be required to use eye drops for
              pupil dilation, this can cause blurred vision temporarily and
              sensitivity to light which may prevent you from driving or working
              for up to 1-24 hours. An optometrist is not an eye doctor so if
              they identify signs of a serious problem with your eyes or vision,
              they will refer you to an ophthalmologist.

              An optometrist appointment will involve a series of tests and
              exams to evaluate your eye and vision health and determine whether
              you need glasses. These tests and exams will help the optometrist
              determine what grade of prescription you may need. When going to
              your appointment, you will need to bring your eyeglasses if you
              already own prescription glasses and your Medicare card. Your
              optometrist may also ask you some questions about your medical
              history. The procedure of your appointment will involve
              confirmation of your Medicare card number and any other health
              insurance you may have. You will then undergo a preliminary eye
              assessment, a detailed eye assessment and then finally your
              optometrist will take time to explain their findings and advise of
              the recommendations that cater to your visual needs.

              Optometrists are healthcare professionals who can perform
              treatments that may help correct refractive errors, double vision
              and treat eye infections by prescribing glasses and/or eye drops.
              The treatments optometrists can perform according to Cleveland
              Clinic are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Refractive Errors:</b>
                Refractive errors such as nearsightedness (myopia),
                farsightedness (hyperopia), presbyopia (age-related
                farsightedness) and astigmatism are common blurry vision
                problems that occur due to the shape of your eye preventing
                light from focusing on your retina. Optometrists can diagnose
                these conditions and prescribe glasses that may help correct
                them.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Double Vision:</b>
                Double vision can be caused by a range of other problems or
                conditions, the optometrist will need to perform an eye test and
                first determine what may be causing it in order to treat it.
                Optometrists can advise on proper fitting glasses or certain eye
                exercises to help. If the underlying problem is a more serious
                condition you may be referred to an ophthalmologist.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Eye Infections:</b>
                Eye infections can be minor issues and may only need
                antihistamine or antibacterial eye drops. If you are concerned
                about your symptoms you can consult with your optometrist.
              </li>

              According to Optometry Australia, the Royal Australian and New
              Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) is planning to
              produce guidelines for optometrists to be able to administer
              intravitreal injections for patients with neovascular macular
              degeneration.

              Yes, an optical dispenser is different from an optometrist
              <b>due to their job responsibilities, education and training.</b>
              Optical dispensers are responsible for dispensing frames and
              lenses according to the prescription supplied by an optometrist or
              an ophthalmologist. Optical dispensers are experts in assisting
              customers with selecting frames and lenses suitable for their face
              shape and facial features. An optometrist is responsible for
              conducting eye examinations for eye and vision health, for
              prescription glasses and to ensure there are no signs of eye
              conditions or diseases. Optometrists are qualified to treat minor
              eye problems and conditions and can refer you to an
              ophthalmologist if they do detect symptoms of a more serious eye
              condition or disease. An ophthalmologist is an eye care specialist
              that is qualified to diagnose and manage eye diseases and perform
              eye surgeries. Optical dispensers are required to complete a
              Certificate IV in optical dispensing and optometrists must
              complete a degree in optometry recognised by the Optometry Board
              of Australia and New Zealand, residence training and apply for
              graduate registration with the Australian Health Practitioner
              Regulation Agency (AHPRA).

            What is the Average Duration of Eye Treatment with an Optometrist?

          <div class="accordion-content-wrapper">
            <p>
              The average duration of eye treatment with an optometrist depends
              on the varying factors of an individual’s visual needs. At Oscar
              Wylee, we allocate approximately 20 minutes for each eye test,
              however, this time frame can vary, especially for those who have
              more complex eye conditions that require more extensive testing.
              Eye treatment may be in the form of prescribing glasses or regular
              eye checkups. Comprehensive eye exams may take longer as this may
              include initial testing, discussing options for treatment and any
              further recommendations for eye care and management. If your
              optometrist sees any signs of concern, they may take additional
              tests before possibly referring you to an ophthalmologist. The
              duration of treatment can change for those who need prescription
              glasses to those who already own prescription glasses and may need
              adjustments or for those who are coming in for a specific issue.

              Eye care quality can change from location to location in Australia
              based on accessibility, optometry workforce availability,
              resources and facilities. Australians living in areas outside the
              major cities were found to have poor access to health services
              than Australians living in major cities; there are 4.8 and 3.6
              attendances per person for remote areas in comparison to 6.4
              visits per person for those living in major cities and inner
              regional areas according to Katerina Kiburg, Mingguang He and
              Angus Turner in a paper published in the Clinical and Experimental
              Ophthalmology Journal. Location matters as accessibility and a
              sufficient number of practising optometrists become more limited
              in more remote areas.

              Factors for eye care quality include five key areas that consist
              of the required standards for quality entry-level optometry care
              according to Optometry Australia. These five key areas include
              clinical care providers, professional and ethical practitioners,
              communicators and collaborators, scholars and lifelong learners
              and quality and risk managers. These five domains for assurance of
              quality eye care in Australia outline the optometrist’s
              responsibilities in meeting the patient and community’s health and
              well-being requirements professionally and ethically and their
              effective and appropriate communication that will enable
              inclusivity of all patients and their responsibility to work with
              others to provide high-quality care. It also includes the
              requirement of their knowledge and skills to provide safe,
              holistic and culturally responsive and patient-centred care, their
              responsibility to continue engaging in evidence-based practice,
              ongoing improvement through professional learning and to carefully
              monitor their actions through reflective processes. Finally, their
              responsibility to prevent harm to patients and others through the
              management and response to risks that may naturally occur in
              optometry is fundamental to the required entry-level competency
              standards according to Optometry Australia.

              At Oscar Wylee, the cost of an optometrist eye test in Australia
              may be covered by Medicare for eligible cardholders so there are
              no out-of-pocket expenses. This process is called bulk billing and
              is part of the Australian Government’s health coverage system
              known as Medicare. If you are not covered under Medicare, eye
              tests cost $70 each.

              can look through the list above, choose from any of the stores
              listed in your region and then select a store based on your
              specific location. There are over 120 stores across Australia in
              all regions. The process for finding an optometrist in different
              locations is the same across all of our Oscar Wylee stores. In
              major cities in Australia, it may be easier to find optometrists
              in more metro locations than in regional or rural areas due to the
              shortage of practising optometrists and long distances of travel
              to access these services.
