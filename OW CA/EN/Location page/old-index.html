          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Optometry is defined as the profession and practice of examining,
              diagnosing and treating eye conditions and ensuring the general
              eye and vision health of patients. It involves using special
              equipment to evaluate whether you require prescription glasses and
              to maintain good eye health. Optometrists are healthcare
              professionals who are qualified to test and examine patients’ eyes
              and their quality of vision, prescribe glasses and medication for
              minor eye problems and are able to identify signs of more serious
              conditions. Opticians are eye care professionals who have been
              trained to fit and dispense frames and lenses based on the
              prescription provided by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

              sensitivity to light which may prevent you from driving or working
              for up to 1-24 hours.

            How to Take an Optometrist Appointment in Canada?

              An optometrist appointment will involve a series of tests and
              exams to evaluate your eye and vision health and determine whether
              you need glasses. These tests and exams will help the optometrist
              determine what grade of prescription you may need. When going to
              your appointment, you will need to bring your eyeglasses if you
              already own prescription glasses. The optometrist may also ask you
              some questions about your medical history. In an eye exam, you
              will undergo a preliminary eye assessment, a detailed eye
              assessment and then finally the optometrist will take time to
              explain their findings and advise on the recommendations that
              cater to your visual needs.

              The information to know before seeing an optometrist is listed

            <ul>

                Make sure you know what your symptoms are if you’re experiencing
                any changes or problems with your vision.
              </li>
              <li>
                A series of eye exams will be conducted to determine whether you

                medical history.
              </li>

                If you already own prescription glasses, be sure to bring them
                with you to your appointment so your optometrist will better
                understand your visual needs.

            What Treatments Does an Optometrist Perform?
          </h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Optometrists are healthcare professionals who can perform
              treatments that may help correct refractive errors, double vision
              and treat eye infections by prescribing glasses and/or eye drops.
              The treatments optometrists can perform according to Cleveland
              Clinic are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Refractive Errors:</strong> Refractive errors such as
                nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), presbyopia
                (age-related farsightedness) and astigmatism are common blurry
                vision problems that occur due to the shape of your eye
                preventing light from focusing on your retina. Optometrists can
                diagnose these conditions and prescribe glasses that may help
                correct them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Double Vision:</strong> Double vision can be caused by a
                range of other problems or conditions, the optometrist will need
                to perform an eye exam and first determine what may be causing
                it in order to treat it. Optometrists can advise on proper
                fitting glasses or certain eye exercises to help. If the
                underlying problem is a more serious condition you may be
                referred to an ophthalmologist.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Eye Infections:</strong> Eye infections can be minor
                issues and may only need antihistamine or antibacterial eye
                drops. If you are concerned about your symptoms you can consult
                with your optometrist.

            Is an Optician Different from an Optometrist?
          </h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Yes, an optician is different from an optometrist
              <strong
                >due to their job responsibilities, education and
                training.</strong
              >
              Opticians are responsible for dispensing frames and lenses
              according to the prescription supplied by an optometrist or an
              ophthalmologist. You will likely see an optician working alongside
              an optometrist, but they will not have the same level of training
              or provide the same services. An optician will help fit frames for
              customers, give advice on the right lenses and manage the supply
              of glasses. They will not be able to conduct comprehensive eye
              exams like an optometrist, nor can they write prescriptions.
              According to the Opticians Association of Canada, an optician will
              have to undergo training at an accredited institution before they
              can begin practice. This can take from a year to 3 years,
              depending on the study load undertaken.

            What is the Average Duration of Eye Treatment with an Optometrist?
          </h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The average duration of eye treatment with an optometrist depends
              on the varying factors of an individual’s visual needs. At Oscar
              Wylee, we allocate approximately 20 minutes for each eye exam,
              however, this time frame can vary, especially for those who have
              more complex eye conditions that require more extensive testing.
              Eye treatment may be in the form of prescribing glasses or regular
              eye checkups. Comprehensive eye exams may take longer as this may
              include initial testing, discussing options for treatment and any
              further recommendations for eye care and management. If your
              optometrist sees any signs of concern, they may take additional
              tests before possibly referring you to an ophthalmologist. The
              duration of treatment can change for those who need prescription
              glasses to those who already own prescription glasses and may need
              adjustments or for those who are coming in for a specific issue.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Eye care quality can change from location to location in Canada
              based on accessibility, optometry workforce availability,
              resources and facilities. According to an article published in the
              National Library of Medicine titled, Geographic availability to
              optometry services across Canada, optometrists across Canada are
              predominantly located in urban areas with the national mean ratio
              being 1.70 optometrists per 10,000 people. This article concluded
              there are gaps in geographic availability relative to ‘need’ and
              ‘supply’ factors. Therefore, in terms of accessibility, there is
              an uneven distribution of optometrists across Canada making a
              person’s access to eye care dependent on their location.
