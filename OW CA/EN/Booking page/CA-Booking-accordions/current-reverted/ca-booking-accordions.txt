<h2>What are the Different Types of Eye Exams?</h2>
</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<div class="accordion-content-wrapper">
<p>The different types of eye exams that a person may experience in a comprehensive eye exam include a <b>colour blindness test, a tonometry test, a visual acuity test, a visual field test, pachymetry, a refraction test, an eye movement test, retinal examination, a pupil function test and a slit lamp examination.</b> These exams and their definitions are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Colour blindness test:</b> A colour blindness test, also known as a colour vision test, is used to detect the specific colours a person can see.</li>
<li><b>Tonometry test:</b> A tonometry test is performed by an optometrist or optician at the start of an eye exam appointment, to measure intraocular eye pressure.</li>
<li><b>Visual acuity test:</b> A visual acuity test is performed to assess the sharpness and clarity of a patient’s vision.</li>
<li><b>Visual field test:</b> A visual field test quantifies how well a person sees through each eye, individually and binocularly.</li>
<li><b>Pachymetry:</b> A pachymetry test is a quick examination that measures the thickness of a person’s cornea.</li>
<li><b>Refraction test:</b> A refraction test is used to detect refractive errors such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), astigmatism and presbyopia.</li>
<li><b>Eye movement test:</b> An eye movement test, also known as extraocular muscle function testing, is performed by an optometrist to evaluate the movement of ocular muscles.</li>
<li><b>Retinal examination:</b> A retinal examination is a diagnostic test performed by an optometrist to closely examine the optic nerve and retina which are located at the back of the eye.</li>
<li><b>Pupil function test:</b> A pupil function test is performed to assess the condition of the patient’s pupils to evaluate the health of the retina, optic nerve and brain.</li>
<li><b>Slit-lamp examination:</b> A slit-lamp examination allows the optometrist to observe different structures of the eye using a microscope.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Colour Blindness Test</h3>
<p>A colour blindness test, also known as a colour vision test, is <b>used to detect the specific colours a person can see.</b> A colour vision test typically uses a colour plate test performed by an optometrist which uses images made up of different coloured dots with a number in the middle for the patient to identify. There are different colour plates made up of certain colours to identify different types of colour blindness which is an eye condition that causes issues with a person’s colour vision. Colour vision deficiency causes a person to see colours in a different way than other people or to have trouble seeing specific colours.</p>
<h3>2. Tonometry Test</h3>
<p>A tonometry test is performed by an optometrist or optician at the start of an eye exam appointment, known as pre-testing, to <b>measure intraocular eye pressure.</b> One type of tonometry test called non-contact tonometry involves a machine that blows a puff of air into the eyes using a rapid air pulse which flattens the patient's cornea to measure the pressure. A tonometry test is often used to diagnose the eye condition glaucoma as one of its main signs is high eye pressure.</p>
<h3>3. Visual Acuity Test</h3>
<p>A visual acuity test is <b>performed to assess the sharpness and clarity of a patient’s vision.</b> Visual acuity is tested one eye at a time commonly using a Snellen chart or can also be tested with a LogMAR eye chart. This test involves a patient reading letters from an eye chart which will give the optometrist a measure of their visual acuity using a fraction, for example, 20/20. A visual acuity test is used to detect refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism.</p>
<div class="accordion-img-wrapper"><img src="https://d2o51ft7emegr.cloudfront.net/pub/media/wysiwyg/booking-accordion-images/_01_Visual-Acuity-Test-900x600.jpg" alt="Patient having a Visual Acuity Test"></div>
<h3>4. Visual Field Test</h3>
<p>A visual field test <b>quantifies how well a person sees through each eye, individually and binocularly.</b> An optometrist performs this test which allows them to establish a baseline of the patient's vision to diagnose eye diseases as well as eye injuries. The test is typically performed on a machine and maps the patient’s visual scope including their peripheral vision which allows the optometrist to identify any vision loss present. The length of time for a visual field test can differ depending on the type of test performed and the model of the machine, varying from 10-40 minutes.</p>
<h3>5. Pachymetry</h3>
<p>A pachymetry test is a quick examination that <b>measures the thickness of a person’s cornea.</b> A pachymetry test is typically performed to identify signs of glaucoma but can also be used to diagnose conditions of the cornea. The process of this test can include using a probing tool or may be done without contact, using a pretesting machine. A pachymetry test takes approximately five minutes and is performed by an eye care professional.</p>
<h3>6. Refraction Test</h3>
<p>A refraction test is used to <b>detect refractive errors such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), astigmatism and presbyopia.</b> The types of refraction tests include a retinoscopy, phoropter refraction test and an autorefractor test. A retinoscopy tests for refraction using a retinoscope which is a handheld device that shines light into the patient’s eyes to determine how light reflects off the retina. A phoropter refraction test involves the patient looking through various lenses in a phoropter and the optometrist will select the most appropriate combination of lenses to find their prescription for glasses or contact lenses. Lastly, an autorefractor test is performed using an autorefractor, which is a computer-controlled machine that measures refraction.</p>
<h3>7. Eye Movement Test</h3>
<p>An eye movement test, also known as extraocular muscle function testing, is <b>performed by an optometrist to evaluate the movement of ocular muscles.</b> The test involves a patient moving their eyes in different directions which can help the optometrist see if any abnormalities with movement could be contributing to uncontrolled eye movements.</p>
<h3>8. Retinal Examination</h3>
<p>A retinal examination, also known as an ophthalmoscopy or fundoscopy, is a <b>diagnostic test performed by an optometrist to closely examine the optic nerve and retina</b> which are located at the back of the eye. A retinal examination typically involves using specialised tools such as an ophthalmoscope to check for signs of eye diseases or any other irregularities. Certain eye diseases that can be diagnosed in a retinal examination include eye cancer, glaucoma and macular degeneration. This procedure can also provide important information about medical diagnoses such as diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
<h3>9. Pupil Function Test</h3>
<p>A pupil function test is performed to <b>assess the condition of the patient’s pupils to evaluate the health of the retina, optic nerve and brain.</b> A pupil function test may involve shining a light on each of the pupils to test if they constrict in response to light. The test will record the size and shape of the pupil while this takes place.</p>

<h3>10. Slit-lamp Examination</h3>
<p>A slit-lamp examination <b>allows the optometrist to observe different structures of the eye using a microscope</b> with a bright light which produces a visualisation of the eye in the form of three-dimensional measurements. A slit-lamp exam will look at a patient's lens, cornea, optic nerve and retina to identify possible signs of eye diseases or abnormalities such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and cataracts. This eye exam may require the patient’s eyes to be dilated as it allows the optometrist to have better visualisation of the eye.</p>

<p>Yes, an optician is different from an optometrist <strong>due to their job responsibilities, education and training.</strong> Opticians are responsible for dispensing frames and lenses according to the prescription supplied by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. You will likely see an optician working alongside an optometrist, but they will not have the same level of training or provide the same services. An optician will help fit frames for customers, give advice on the right lenses and manage the supply of glasses. They will not be able to conduct comprehensive eye exams like an optometrist, nor can they write prescriptions. According to the Opticians Association of Canada, an optician will have to undergo training at an accredited institution before they can begin practice. This can take from a year to 3 years, depending on the study load undertaken.</p>

<h2>What is the Average Duration of Eye Treatment with an Optometrist?</h2>
</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<div class="accordion-content-wrapper">
<p>The average duration of eye treatment with an optometrist depends on the varying factors of an individual’s visual needs. At Oscar Wylee, we allocate approximately 20 minutes for each eye exam, however, this time frame can vary, especially for those who have more complex eye conditions that require more extensive testing. Eye treatment may be in the form of prescribing glasses or regular eye checkups. Comprehensive eye exams may take longer as this may include initial testing, discussing options for treatment and any further recommendations for eye care and management. If your optometrist sees any signs of concern, they may take additional tests before possibly referring you to an ophthalmologist. The duration of treatment can change for those who need prescription glasses to those who already own prescription glasses and may need adjustments or for those who are coming in for a specific issue.</p>

<h2>How does Eye Care Quality Change from Location to Location in Canada?</h2>
</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<div class="accordion-content-wrapper">
<p>Eye care quality can change from location to location in Canada based on accessibility, optometry workforce availability, resources and facilities. According to an article published in the National Library of Medicine titled, Geographic availability to optometry services across Canada, optometrists across Canada are predominantly located in urban areas with the national mean ratio being 1.70 optometrists per 10,000 people. This article concluded there are gaps in geographic availability relative to ‘need’ and ‘supply’ factors. Therefore, in terms of accessibility, there is an uneven distribution of optometrists across Canada making a person’s access to eye care dependent on their location.</p>
