                Eye care quality can change from location to location in Canada
                based on accessibility, optometry workforce availability and
                resources and facilities. According to an article published in
                the National Library of Medicine titled, Geographic availability
                to optometry services across Canada, optometrists across Canada
                are predominantly located in urban areas with the national mean
                ratio being 1.70 optometrists per 10,000 people. This article
                concluded there are gaps in geographic availability relative to
                ‘need’ and ‘supply’ factors. Therefore, in terms of
                accessibility, there is an uneven distribution of optometrists
                across Canada making a person’s access to eye care dependent on
                their location. There is currently no evidence that suggests
                there are certain factors that affect the quality of an eye
                exam. However, it may be helpful to ensure you are well rested
                before your appointment to ensure your comfort during the
                testing process. The eye diseases that may be most difficult to
                diagnose are types that do not present early symptoms or cause
                symptoms that are similar to other eye diseases. Keratococonus,
                for example, can trigger the same symptoms as other eye
                conditions and requires unique corneal mapping equipment to
                properly identify the minimal changes in the shape of your
                cornea. Therefore, making Keratococonus a more difficult eye
                disease to diagnose.

                  identify any signs of eye problems early.</b
                >
                Eye exams are essential for diagnosing common eye problems such
                as refractive errors, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy,
                and age-related macular degeneration. For many eye conditions,
                early detection is key to preserving eyesight. It is best to
                book eye exam appointments when advised rather than waiting
                until you have an issue with your eyesight. According to the
                Canadian Association of Optometrists, even if you do not require
                prescription glasses, getting regular eye exams helps with
                ensuring all parts of your eye are healthy. Vision can also
                change over time, especially as you age, so you may need a new
                prescription every few years. Only half of the individuals who
                are considered high risk for vision loss see an optometrist
                every year according to the Centers for Disease Control and
                Prevention

                for your child as their vision is still developing. It can also
                help with detecting any eye problems early to prevent the impact
                on their vision health later in life. According to Peel Region
                in Canada, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) covers free
                eye exams once a year for children 19 years and under. Vision
                disorders are a common overall health problem in Canada. and the
                United States. An estimate of almost 25% of school-aged children
                reported to have vision problems according to a position
                statement from the Canadian Association of Optometrists. After
                the age of 40, vision loss cases double every decade and triples
                at the age of 75 according to the Canadian Association of
                Optometrists.

                To choose the best optometrist for an eye exam, you may need to
                consider key aspects such as
                <b
                  >customer reviews, store location, equipment and insurance
                  acceptance.</b
                >
                The steps on how to choose the best optometrist for an eye exam
                are listed below.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> Firstly, read customer
                  reviews and look out for how thorough the testing process is,
                  which can indicate the quality of eye examinations. Eye exams
                  are typically 30 minutes, which allows the optometrist to
                  fully assess the different regions of the eye.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Store Location:</strong> Ensure the store location of
                  the optometrist is convenient for you to get to. Choosing a
                  closer store location can help with choosing the best
                  optometrist for an eye exam, so you can easily see an eye care
                  professional for any sudden eye problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Equipment:</strong> Ensuring the equipment is modern
                  and not too old can be important for optimal examination
                  performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Insurance Acceptance:</strong> Lastly, check that your
                  private health insurance is accepted at your chosen
                  optometrist. The best optometrist for an eye exam will be one
                  that accepts not only your health insurance provider but also
                  other providers to enable accessible, affordable eye care.
                  Here at Oscar Wylee, we accept all major private health
                  insurances in-store.

                An optometrist, also known as a doctor of optometry, conducts
                eye exams. An eye doctor in Canada is a licensed,
                board-certified healthcare professional who provides first point

                Yes, an optician is different from an optometrist
                <b

                >
                Opticians are responsible for dispensing frames and lenses
                according to the prescription supplied by an optometrist or an
                ophthalmologist. You will likely see an optician working
                alongside an optometrist, but they will not have the same level
                of training or provide the same services. An optician will help
                fit frames for customers, give advice on the right lenses and
                manage the supply of glasses. They will not be able to conduct
                comprehensive eye exams like an optometrist, nor can they write
                prescriptions. According to the Opticians Association of Canada,
                an optician will have to undergo training at an accredited
                institution before they can begin practice. This can take from a
                year to 3 years, depending on the study load undertaken.

                Pre-testing with a team member involves a team member conducting
                an auto-refraction test, taking your eye pressure measurement
                and photographs of the retina. Screen tests are performed before
                seeing the optometrist, who will review the results. This

                examining and optometrist consultation will involve the

                Optometrists are healthcare professionals
                <b
                  >who can perform treatments that may help correct refractive

                >
                The cost of the exam may be based on what your vision condition
                is and the nature of the necessary eye exams involved. The
                treatments optometrists can perform are listed below.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Refractive Errors:</strong> Refractive errors such as
                  nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia),
                  presbyopia (age-related farsightedness) and astigmatism are
                  common blurry vision problems that occur due to the shape of
                  your eye preventing light from focusing on your retina.
                  Optometrists can diagnose these conditions and prescribe
                  glasses that may help correct them. If you are experiencing
                  symptoms such as blurriness, eye strain or having to squint to
                  see clearly, you can easily book an eye exam for refractive
                  errors. If your vision does require corrective glasses, the
                  cost of your exam may be affected as it may include other
                  testing procedures and the price of your new prescription
                  frames and lenses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Double Vision:</strong> Double vision can be caused by
                  a range of other problems or conditions, the optometrist will
                  need to perform an eye exam and first determine what may be
                  causing it in order to treat it. Optometrists can advise on
                  proper fitting glasses or certain eye exercises to help. If
                  the underlying problem is a more serious condition, you may be
                  referred to an ophthalmologist. If the optometrist identifies
                  signs of double vision, the overall cost may be affected as it
                  will likely require additional testing processes for further
                  assessment. You can call or talk to the staff in-store about
                  booking an eye exam to check whether you have double vision or
                  not.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Eye Infections:</strong> Eye infections can be minor
                  issues and may only need antihistamine or antibacterial eye
                  drops. If you are concerned about your symptoms, you can
                  consult with your optometrist. Eye infections can easily be
                  diagnosed with a regular eye exam. However, the cost may still
                  depend on the severity of your condition and if the
                  optometrist deems it necessary to conduct any other tests.

                that require more extensive testing. Eye treatment may be in the

                Comprehensive eye exams may take longer as this may include
                initial testing, discussing options for treatment and any
                further recommendations for eye care and management. If your
                optometrist sees any signs of concern, they may take additional

                duration of treatment can change for those who need prescription

            <h3>How Often Should One Undergo a Comprehensive Eye Exam?</h3>

                At Oscar Wylee, we recommend everyone undergo a comprehensive
                eye exam
                <b
                  >at least once every two years. Other factors may impact how
                  often a person should have an eye exam, which includes the age
                  of the patient, if they have any eye diseases and if they have
                  certain medical conditions.</b
                >
                If a person is over the age of 65, a yearly eye exam is
                recommended as a person’s eyes change as they get older. A
                person with glaucoma or a retinal detachment will likely have
                more frequent eye exams so an optometrist can monitor these
                conditions. Finally, if a person has diabetes or high blood
                pressure, they may also need more frequent eye exams as these
                conditions can affect a person’s vision. The most common or more
                serious eye diseases and their recommended frequency of eye
                exams are listed below.

              What are the Signs that Indicate a Need for an Immediate Eye Exam?

            <div class="accordion-content-wrapper">
              <p>
                There are certain signs a person can look out for that indicate
                they should book an appointment for an immediate eye exam,
                including changes to your vision, such as
                <b
                  >blurry vision, seeing spots in your vision, pain in the eyes,
                  if you have a foreign body in your eye and light
                  sensitivity.</b
                >
                However, it is always recommended that you see an optometrist
                when experiencing any other changes to your vision. The signs
                that indicate a need for an immediate eye exam are listed below.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Blurry Vision:</strong> Blurry vision may cause
                  difficulty in seeing objects, people’s faces and shapes
                  clearly or with sharpness. If you’re experiencing blurry
                  vision, you may need prescription glasses and therefore will
                  need to schedule an eye exam. If you already wear prescription
                  glasses and experience blurry vision, this may indicate that
                  you need to update your current prescription, which requires
                  an eye exam.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Seeing Spots in Your Vision:</strong> Seeing spots in
                  your vision may be associated with eye floaters as these spots
                  may be parts of the vitreous that have clumped together,
                  floating and drifting across a person's vision. It can be a
                  sign that you need an immediate eye exam as it could indicate
                  an underlying condition. However, while this symptom is not
                  typically harmful and can be a natural sign of ageing, it is
                  essential to address with an optometrist.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pain in the Eyes:</strong> Pain in the eyes can be a
                  sign of many different eye conditions and therefore, should be
                  brought to the attention of an optometrist promptly. An eye
                  exam can help determine the initial cause of this symptom and
                  narrow down the most suitable treatment plan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Foreign Body in your Eye:</strong> A foreign body in
                  your eye may require the immediate attention of an optometrist
                  or medical professional to determine the initial cause. The
                  feeling of having something in your eye can stem from several
                  different causes, making it crucial to have your eyes examined
                  to rule out any major eye conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Light Sensitivity:</strong> Light Sensitivity can be
                  an unpleasant symptom of many different eye conditions, which
                  is why it is important to get an immediate eye exam. This can
                  help in identifying what may be causing this symptom and help
                  determine what treatment may be needed.

                >
                According to Stanford University, a retinal examination can
                provide important information about a medical diagnosis,
                including high blood pressure and diabetes. A retinal
                examination is a type of test involving specialised tools like
                an ophthalmoscope, which looks at a patient’s retina and optic
                nerve.

                In the case of many eye diseases, early detection can be crucial
                as it can prevent vision loss, which is why regular eye exams
                are so important.
