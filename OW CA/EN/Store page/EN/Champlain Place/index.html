                To compare optometrists in Champlain Place in Dieppe, you can
                compare factors such as eye
                <b

                To take care of your vision and eye health, it is important to
                receive an eye exam at least once every two years. Different
                types of tests can be performed in an eye exam, and not all
                optometrists may offer the same tests. Health insurance can be
                used to help cover some of the cost of your frames and lenses.
                To find out if your health insurance is accepted at an
                optometrist in Champlain Place, visit their website. In the case
                of Oscar Wylee, we accept all major health insurances and
                provide on-the-spot claims in-store. There are many different
                lens options available for prescription glasses, such as
                single-vision, multifocal, and high-index lenses. Most
                optometrists in Dieppe at Champlain Place will offer these
                lenses, although it is good to make sure. There are also lens
                add-ons available to enhance your glasses, such as
                anti-reflective coating and blue light filters. Finally, if you
                are looking to purchase a pair of glasses after your eye exam,
                you can compare the different styles and colours you are
                interested in from the optometrists in Champlain Place. Oscar
                Wylee offers a wide range of frames with vintage and modern
                inspirations in bold colours and subtle designs.

                <li>
                  <b>A Tonometry Test: </b>An optometrist or optician will
                  conduct a tonometry test which involves the use of a machine
                  that will release small puffs of air into your eyes. This will
                  assist with measuring pressure in the eye.

                <li>
                  <b>A Digital Photograph: </b>An optometrist or optician may
                  take a digital photograph of your eye which can be kept on
                  record to use in future appointments to evaluate any changes
                  to your eye.

                <li>
                  <b>Slit Lamp Test: </b>A slit lamp test can be used to
                  evaluate your eye health, by examining your cornea and iris
                  which are the anterior and posterior of the eye.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Refraction Test: </b> During a refraction test, an
                  optometrist will have you view an image through different
                  lenses and ask you to confirm which helps you see the image
                  clearer.
                </li>
                <!-- <li><b>Visual Field Test: </b>A visual field test can assist with assessing your
                                      peripheral vision, which may be beneficial for identifying any signs of glaucoma.
                                  </li> -->
                <li>
                  <b>Dilated Fundus Exam: </b> A dilated fundus exam can help an
                  optometrist assess your health in more detail by getting a
                  clear view of the retina. This test is typically carried out
                  for patients with diabetes and those who may be at risk of
