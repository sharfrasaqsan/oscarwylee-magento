<h2 class="subtitle" id="conditions">1. Glaucoma</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glaucoma is a </span><b>group of eye problems caused by damage to the optic nerve, resulting from issues with the eye’s intraocular fluid drainage system.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can eventually lead to complete vision loss and can occur in either one eye or both eyes. Glaucoma is more likely to develop in people who are of older age, have a family history of glaucoma, have thin corneas, are near or far-sighted and have diabetes. For many people with this eye condition, there are usually no symptoms which makes early detection quite difficult. Although in advanced, severe glaucoma, tunnel vision can occur which results in mobility issues. In acute angle closure glaucoma, symptoms include pain, red eyes, headaches, blurry vision, halos around lights and nausea.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The types of glaucoma are open-angle glaucoma, normal tension glaucoma, congenital glaucoma, traumatic glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation and uveitic glaucoma. Glaucoma can be diagnosed through an eye pressure test, an eye health check and a visual field test. Glaucoma may be treated with anti-glaucoma medication, prescription eye drops, laser treatment and surgery. </span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">2. Cataracts</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cataracts are a type of eye condition that</span><b> forms in the eye lens due to the clumping of protein, leading to a decline in clear vision.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This process occurs naturally with advancing age, which is why they are so common. Some of the main causes of cataracts include being born with congenital cataracts, sustaining trauma to the eye, from medication and if you have diabetes. Symptoms of cataracts include cloudy or foggy vision, double vision in one eye, poor night vision and increased sensitivity to light.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age-related cataracts can be categorised into three main types, these being nuclear, cortical and posterior subcapsular. Cataracts can be diagnosed through an eye exam and their progression can be monitored by your optometrist. According to the Kellogg Eye Center, by the age of 65, over 90% of people will have developed a form of cataract. Cataracts may be prevented by wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes which may help to delay the onset of early cataracts. Early cataracts may be treated with a change in the person’s prescription and for advanced cataracts, surgery may be recommended.</span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">3. Uveitis</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uveitis refers to a </span><b>group of conditions that causes eye inflammation, commonly due to the immune system fighting an infection.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This eye condition causes damage to the uvea which is the middle layer of the eye and is made up of the choroid, ciliary body and iris. Uveitis can be caused by two main reasons, infection such as shingles and histoplasmosis and autoimmune diseases such as AIDS, Lupus and psoriasis. The symptoms of uveitis include eye floaters, blurry vision, red eyes, eye pain and sensitivity to light. According to the National Eye Institute, there are four main types of uveitis that affect separate parts of the eye, these are anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis and panuveitis.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This eye condition is diagnosed through a dilated eye exam performed by an optometrist and through an understanding of the patient’s medical history. This eye condition is common for people between the ages of 20 and 60 and people who smoke cigarettes have a higher risk of developing uveitis. Prevention of this eye condition comes in the form of preventing the autoimmune diseases that cause it. Uveitis may be treated with medication such as eye drops, injections or pills.</span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">4. Dry Eyes</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry eyes is an eye condition that occurs when the </span><b>eyes are unable to produce enough tears or tears aren't able to provide adequate lubrication to the surface of the eyes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dry eyes can be caused by multiple factors, such as the eyes not producing enough tears, or the tears in your eyes drying out too quickly. Dry eyes could also be caused by issues in the tear film and its makeup. The tear film is composed of three layers and if one of these layers is compromised, it could lead to dry eyes.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symptoms of dry eyes include a feeling of burning, itchy or scratching eyes, the eyes becoming sensitive to light, redness around the eyes and blurry vision. Dry eyes can be diagnosed by a healthcare professional often using a Schirmer test that measures the eyes’ production of tears. Dry eye treatment involves artificially moisturising the eyes using eye drops which may alleviate or ease the symptoms. For more severe cases of dry eyes, steroid drops may be used in the treatments.</span></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">5. Presbyopia</h2>
<p class="para-content" style="letter-spacing: -0.05px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presbyopia is a </span><b>common age-related eye condition that causes the eyes to lose the ability to focus on close objects.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Presbyopia is a type of refractive error and is a natural part of ageing for a majority of people. Presbyopia is caused by the lens in the eyes becoming harder and losing its flexibility as the eyes age. As the lens is less flexible, the eyes don’t change shape to allow for greater levels of focus. The symptoms of presbyopia include struggling to see things up close, your vision blurring when reading at a normal distance and having headaches or eye strain after you've been reading.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 5 stages of presbyopia that most commonly occur as the eyes age. These types are incidental presbyopia, functional presbyopia, absolute presbyopia, premature presbyopia and nocturnal presbyopia. It can be diagnosed through an eye exam with an optometrist who will assess your vision and discuss treatment if necessary. Presbyopia symptoms can be treated with corrective prescriptions. Reading glasses are the most common type of treatment for presbyopia but they may also recommend multifocal lenses to correct any other vision conditions that are present.</span></p>

<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">6. Floaters</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floaters, or </span><a href="https://oscarwylee.ca/glasses/eye/floaters-definition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eye floaters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is an eye condition that </span><b>causes small specks or spots to appear in a person’s vision due to changes in the vitreous fluid that fills the eye.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a person has floaters in the eye, it does not typically affect their vision although they can be more noticeable when looking at bright light. The main causes of eye floaters include eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, asteroid hyalosis, eye tumours, eye injury, ageing and bleeding in the eye. Eye floaters can look different to every person but some common things they may see as floaters are lines, strings, cobwebs, threadlike strands and black or grey dots.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye floaters are diagnosed through an eye exam performed by an optometrist who will assess the eye which may include having the eyes dilated to allow the optometrist to better see the vitreous and back of the eye. Eye floaters are a common condition, especially for older people due to the eyes naturally ageing which causes the fluid that fills the eyeball to shrink, causing small particles to move and float across your vision. According to Healthdirect Australia, eye floaters cannot be prevented although they can be managed if they are affecting the person’s vision or everyday life. For the people that require treatment, they may be recommended by their eye doctor to have eye surgery or laser therapy to treat the eye floaters.</span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">7. Red Eyes</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red eyes is a common symptom of many eye conditions and is </span><b>caused by the dilation of small blood vessels that are in the white of the eye which causes the eyes to appear more red than usual. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common cause of </span><a href="https://oscarwylee.ca/glasses/eye/red-or-bloodshot"><span style="font-weight: 400;">red or bloodshot eyes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include allergies, dry eyes and broken blood vessels. The symptoms of red or bloodshot eyes include itching, eye pain, eye discharge, swollen eyes and changes to your vision.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red eyes can be diagnosed through an eye exam by an optometrist who will assess the appearance of the eye and also perform standard eye exams. There are multiple ways to prevent red or bloodshot eyes, some of which include staying hydrated, avoiding fans at night, using a humidifier and using eye drops. Red eyes should first be assessed by an eye care professional and they may advise treatments such as eye drops including lubricating, antibiotic, antiviral, steroid and allergy eye drops and avoiding allergy triggers.</span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">8. Night Blindness</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Night blindness is an eye problem that </span><b>impairs a person’s vision in a way that causes them to struggle to see in dim light or at night</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also known as nyctalopia, night blindness can impact a person’s life, affecting their ability to drive at night. The common causes of night blindness include glaucoma, myopia, vitamin A deficiency, cataracts and diabetes. The main symptom of night blindness is difficulty seeing in the dark. Additional symptoms may include a sensitivity to light, seeing halos or glare around lights and having cloudy or blurry vision when in dim light.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to have your vision seen by an optometrist if you suspect you have night blindness to determine if another eye condition is causing it and, therefore, can be treated. Night blindness cannot be prevented if it is congenital or genetic. However, to reduce your risk of developing night blindness, you can lead a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced diet, especially foods with vitamin A. Night blindness may be treated with corrective lenses such as prescription glasses and contact lenses, or with surgery if it is caused by a serious eye condition.</span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">9. Lazy Eyes</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazy eyes, also known as amblyopia, is an eye condition that </span><b>describes a person with one eye that has weaker vision than the other due to developmental issues such as unusual nerve pathways to the retina. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The causes of lazy eye include glaucoma, refractive amblyopia, strabismus and trauma to the eye. Symptoms of this eye condition may include eye misalignment, nearsightedness, farsightedness, crossed eyes, and repeated squinting and closing of the eyes.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This eye condition can be diagnosed through assessment from a healthcare professional such as an optometrist. They will perform several diagnostic tests to determine if a person has lazy eyes, these may include checking their visual acuity and performing a cover test to see how well the eyes follow a moving object. A Lazy eye can look like a crossed eye, or a misaligned eye and also be completely normal. Lazy eye is a common condition that affects 3 in 100 children, according to the National Eye Institute, an institute of the American government. Lazy eyes cannot be prevented although early diagnosis and treatment of lazy eyes can reduce any possible harm the condition could cause. Its treatments include corrective eyeglasses or contact lenses, patches for the eyes, eye drops and eye training.</span></p>

<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">10. Colour Blindness</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour blindness is an eye condition that means a person is </span><b>able to perceive colour but has trouble telling the difference between certain colours.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colour blindness is typically genetic, therefore, you are likely to develop this eye condition if there is a family history of it. It may also be caused by other conditions such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Symptoms of colourblindness include difficulty seeing colours and their brightness and an inability to tell the difference between similar colours.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Healthdirect Australia, there are three main types of colour blindness, these are red-green colourblindness (deuteranopia and protanopia), blue-yellow colour blindness (tritanopia) and complete colour blindness (monochromatism). Colour blindness can be diagnosed by an optometrist through various colour vision tests to determine if the person has colour blindness and what type. There is no prevention for colour blindness that is congenital but there are ways a person can potentially prevent colour blindness from developing later in life such as getting regular eye exams and leading a healthy lifestyle. There is no treatment available for congenital colour blindness although education and management of a person’s colour vision deficiency can minimise disruption to their lives.</span></p>
</section>
<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">11. Eyestrain</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyestrain is a very common eye problem </span><b>caused by the eyes concentrating on tasks or objects for a long period of time.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It typically doesn’t pose any threat to eye health or overall health. There are three main causes of eyestrain and fatigue, these include writing and typing, driving long distances and reading for long periods of time without eye rest. The symptoms of eyestrain include trouble focusing, double or blurred vision, sore or irritated eyes and increased sensitivity to light. Eye fatigue can be diagnosed by an eye care professional or general practitioner by assessing the symptoms the person is experiencing and understanding when these symptoms occur and what they are related to.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye fatigue may be prevented by blinking often to moisten the eyes when concentrating on specific tasks and when working on a computer, enlarging the text on the screen to make it easier to read. Wearing glasses may also be used to correct refractive errors which may be underlying causes of eye fatigue and strain. Eyestrain can be managed and treated with various types of lifestyle changes and treatment methods, some of which include rest, taking breaks between intense concentration and using lubricating eye drops.</span></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">12. Vision Changes</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision changes are a common sign of many eye conditions and are </span><b>characterised by a sudden difference in your ability to see normally.</b></p>
<p class="para-content"><b>If your vision changes, you should see an optometrist immediately as it could be a sign of a serious eye condition that needs treatment.</b></p>
<p class="para-content"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision changes are commonly caused by refractive errors that affect the eye’s capacity to see clearly, these include myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. Vision changes may be caused by a wide variety of eye conditions but some of the most common are cataracts, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Possible vision changes include blurred vision, double vision, cloudy vision, spots in vision and loss of vision.</span></b></p>
<p class="para-content"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While vision changes cannot necessarily be prevented, there are some steps a person can take to ensure they are protecting their eyes from certain problems. This includes having regular eye exams, leading a healthy and balanced lifestyle and being aware of your family history of eye problems. Treatments for vision changes are dependent on the cause, for example, if the vision changes are due to refractive errors, they can be treated with prescription glasses. Other more involved treatments such as laser therapy and surgery may be used to treat diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.</span></b></p>

<section class="square-section">
<h2 class="subtitle">13. Excess Tearing</h2>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excess tearing, also known as watery eyes and clinically as epiphora, </span><b>occurs when there is an overflow of tears, spilling onto the face.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Excess tearing or watery eyes are caused by two main reasons, overproduction of tears and blocked tear ducts. Other causes may include dry eyes, allergies and keratitis. The main symptom of excess tearing is an overflow of tears in the eyes spilling onto the face. It may also lead to eye redness, blurred vision and sore eyes.</span></p>

<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retinal disorders are a </span><b>term for a group of conditions that affect the retina</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The retina is a layer of tissue located directly at the back of the eye and its main function is to receive light that comes in through the eye's lens and translate that light into images. The retina is made up of two parts, the macula, and the peripheral retina. According to the Mayo Clinic, the common retinal disorders and diseases include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear and detachment and macular hole. Some of the common symptoms among retinal disorders include loss of vision, loss of visual field, eye floaters, blurred or distorted vision and seeing flashes of light.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retinal disorders are diagnosed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist through a comprehensive eye exam. They will also ask for your medical and family history and assess the retina using a slit lamp. The treatment for retinal disorders depends on the specific disorder. For example, retinal tears and detachment may be treated through surgery and diabetic retinopathy can be treated with laser treatment, surgery and injections. </span></p>

There are many causes of crossed eyes (strabismus) such as family history, medical conditions and refractive errors. The most common symptoms of crossed eyes include double vision, misaligned-looking eyes, turning the head to view objects and improper depth perception. There are two types of crossed eyes (strabismus), intermittent exotropia and accommodative esotropia. The first occurs when only one eye is fixated on an object and the other points outwards, the second type occurs when one or both eyes cross when trying to focus on a target.</span></p>
<p class="para-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye care professionals are able to diagnose and treat crossed eyes (strabismus) by testing refraction, visual acuity, alignment and eye health.
